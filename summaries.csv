0,0,"A massive internet outage has affected websites including the Guardian, the UK government’s website gov.uk, Amazon and Reddit. The issue made the sites inaccessible to many users for more than an hour on Tuesday morning. The outage was traced to a failure in a content delivery network (CDN) run by Fastly. It began at about 11am UK time, with visitors to a huge number of sites receiving error messages including, “Error 503 service unavailable” and a terse “connection failure”. Others affected included the publishers CNN, the New York Times, and the Financial Times, as well as the streaming services Twitch and Hulu. As well as bringing down some websites entirely, the failure also broke specific sections of other services, such as the servers for Twitter that host the social network’s emojis. The failure was not geographically universal. Users in some locations, such as Berlin, reported no problems, while others experienced massive failures across the internet. Outages were reported in locations as varied as London, Texas and New Zealand. Within minutes of the outage starting, Fastly, a cloud computing services provider, acknowledged that its content distribution network was the cause of the problem. The company runs an “edge cloud”, which is designed to speed up loading times for websites, protect them from denial-of-service attacks, and help them deal with bursts of traffic. The technology requires Fastly to sit between most of its clients and their users. That means that if the service suffers a catastrophic failure, it can prevent those companies from operating on the net at all. In an error message posted at 10.58 UK time, Fastly said: “We’re currently investigating potential impact to performance with our CDN services.” It was not until 11.57 UK time, almost an hour later, that Fastly declared the incident over. “The issue has been identified and a fix has been applied. Customers may experience increased origin load as global services return,” the company said in a status update. Despite speculation on social media that the outage was the result of a malicious attack, leading to the hashtag #cyberattack trending on Twitter, there is no evidence pointing to foul play. Instead, the company says a configuration error was at fault. A Fastly spokesperson said: “We identified a service configuration that triggered disruptions across our POPs [points of presence] globally and have disabled that configuration. Our global network is coming back online.” Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the government was aware of the problems with accessing gov.uk. He also said reports that users were unable to book Covid-19 tests online were being investigated as a “matter of urgency”. Asked if ministers believed a malicious foreign group or state was responsible, he said the outage “appears to be... affecting a number of sites globally, it doesn’t appear to be targeted at any one site”. Different websites handled the outage in different ways. The Guardian moved to Twitter to run a dedicated liveblog, while tech news site the Verge published news to a shared Google Doc – until a reporter accidentally shared a link on Twitter that allowed the audience to edit it. The increasing centralisation of internet infrastructure in the hands of a few large companies means that single points of failure can result in sweeping outages. In 2017, a problem at Amazon’s AWS hosting business, for instance, took out some of the world’s biggest websites for several hours across the entire US east coast. In 2020, a problem with Cloudflare, another CDN company, led to a half-hour outage for most of the internet in major cities across Europe and the Americas. The Cloudflare outage was eventually traced back to an error in a single physical link, connecting data centres in Newark and Chicago, that caused a cascading failure that knocked out almost 20 data centres worldwide.","Within minutes of the outage starting, Fastly, a cloud computing services provider, acknowledged that its content distribution network was the cause of the problem.

1,1,"My father, Bob Hamilton, who has died aged 94, was a computer software designer in the industry’s early years, working in the US on the Saturn 4B rocket programme which led to Saturn 5, the launch rocket for the 1969 moon landing. Bob was born in London. His mother, Edith, died when he was seven; he and his older sister, Margot, were brought up by his father, James, who worked for a legal firm, and, at times, by various aunts and uncles. Growing up during the second world war, Bob spent his teenage years in air-raid shelters and left school at 16, working as a tax office clerk while waiting for the inevitable conscription call. He signed up in June 1945, and would have been one of the last groups to be sent to Burma. A protracted training period in the UK avoided this, however, and instead he went to India in April 1946, followed by Iraq and Egypt, before returning home in April 1948. A visit to the Festival of Britain in 1951 changed Bob’s life. In the Dome of Discovery he saw a Ferranti computer on display – built solely to demonstrate a game called Nim and requiring six cabinets full of electronics – and, as he later said, “I was hooked”. Having already applied to do evening courses at the University of London, he immediately switched to pure maths, applied maths and physics, and by 1956 had graduated, with the highest percentage of firsts across all the university’s colleges. Two years later, he boarded a flight to Canada to pursue a career in programming. After living in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, Bob moved to the US in 1962, heading to California, where in June 1964 he began work on a new project for Nasa: the Saturn 4B rocket. In true sardonic style, Bob described his feelings about the project at the time as being “an appalling waste of money” but admitted that, back in the UK a few years later, he was one of the fascinated millions who stayed up to watch the moon landing – an event which he must have felt incredibly proud to have been a part of, though he was always far too self-deprecating to admit it. In 1965, Bob accepted a job offer at the British computing company ICT (later taken over by ICL) – “I sat in Richmond Park on a Friday afternoon, watching polo. The sun shone. This was swinging London” – and remained in the industry until his retirement in the early 1990s. He was an active sportsman, skiing, water-skiing, squash and tennis being his preferred activities. He played tennis several times a week into his 90s and was a member and treasurer of his local club for more than 20 years. Bob’s wit, intelligence, kindness and energy for life were unwavering. He is survived by his wife, Patricia (nee Mandelik), whom he met while on a skiing holiday in 1968 and married the following year, and me.","My father, Bob Hamilton, who has died aged 94, was a computer software designer in the industry’s early years, working in the US on the Saturn 4B rocket programme which led to Saturn 5, the launch rocket for the 1969 moon landing.

2,2,"What will your next phone look like? Will it be a featureless black rectangle from the front, with a bulbous many-lensed camera unit emerging from the rear? Or will it be … different? Samsung is one of a growing number of companies betting that now is time for a change. The company’s latest phones, the Galaxy Flip 3 and Galaxy Fold 3, aren’t going to be mistaken for an iPhone at a distance: both are built, in different ways, around a flexible screen, with a hinge that bisects the whole device and fundamentally changes how it works. Of the two, the Fold 3 is more traditional. When the phone is in its folded state, it looks like a normal – albeit extremely thick – smartphone, with a screen on one side and a big camera on the other. But unfold it like a book, and it becomes a device closer in size to an iPad mini, a tablet form factor beloved by its users but curiously abandoned by Apple over the past few years in favour of the chunkier (and more expensive) full-size models. For me, it’s hard to love. I was never a fan of the iPad mini, which felt awkwardly neither small enough to be particularly portable nor large enough to be a significant improvement on a phone, and the Fold feels in-hand like a compromise on a compromise, neither collapsing small enough to feel as good as a smartphone nor expanding well enough to completely do its job as a tablet. But the Flip 3 is a different story. Unfolded, the phone is fairly traditional if a bit on the large side. But fold it in half vertically, and it becomes a perfect square, about the size of a well-filled wallet, and compact enough to fit in a pocket. A miniature screen on the outside serves to show basic notifications, and enable a simple selfie mode you can use without even opening it up. The two phones have a bevy of software features to take advantage of their foldability, from using the rear screen to show a preview of a photo to its subject to letting the device stay half open and chucking, say, playback controls on the bottom half and a video on the top. But those are icing on the cake: the success, or failure, of the concept hinges (sorry) on whether a folding phone is actually something you want. Samsung, of course, hope it is. At the launch of the two devices, I spoke to Conor Pierce, who leads its mobile division in the UK and Ireland. His goal for the future is to change how we talk about smartphones – and ideally, to shift it away from a world of Apple v the rest. “What we want to try to do is maybe disrupt and change the game when it comes to an OS conversation,” Pierce said. “When you walk into a store, ‘do you want a folding phone or do you want a flat phone’ should be the first question you’re asked. “The future is folding, it’s only a matter of time. I’ve been through this for decades, I know it’s inevitable that folding will become the de-facto form factor for these devices.” Not yet … Pierce may be right that the future is folding, but the campaign for Samsung is to convince people that the present is, too. Folding phones are a couple of years old, now, and yet they’re still a novelty on the street. And that’s despite generally good reviews. Our consumer technology editor, Samuel Gibbs, had nothing but good things to say about the previous generation of the Galaxy Fold, for instance: The Galaxy Z Fold 2 is an absolute triumph for Samsung, cementing foldable screen devices as not only a possible novelty but as an actually good, useful device worth buying right now. The Z Fold 2 is exciting, useful in ways you may not expect and proves that the future of smartphones, tablets and computers is one unified adaptable device. One day relatively soon folding screen devices will be mainstream and we need devices like the Z Fold 2 to make that happen. The glaring hindrance last time round was the price. The Fold 2 cost a staggering £1,799 new. The Fold 3 lops £200 off that, bringing the phone down to £1,599, but the real standout is the Flip 3, which is starting at £949, well under the – analysts assure me – Psychologically Important £1,000 Line. That’s good because the Flip and Fold 3 do not completely erase their other major weak spot: the hinge itself. The devices have come a long way since folding phones first arrived on the scene, but it’s still hard to forget that the phone has a big crease down the middle where it folds in half. You can feel it as you swipe up and down the screen, you can see it if you hold the phone at an angle, and if you’re the sort to let yourself get annoyed by it, it will almost certainly drive you mad. But soon? What interests me more than the question of whether or not you should get the Flip 3 as your next phone, is the conditions that led to its creation. Because I have a feeling that the next few years of tech are going to see a flourishing of this sort of novel design approach. The narrow explanation, of course, is the availability of technology to make flexible displays, and sure, that’s a big part of it. Flexible screens have been an answer in search of a question for a while now, and foldable phones are certainly a more compelling use case than LG’s rollable TV (priced at “if you have to ask, you can’t afford”). But a bigger part, I think, is that, even as phones continue to grow in their importance to our everyday lives, we’re seeing diminishing returns on the old drivers of upgrades. More megapixels won’t do much to improve the quality of your pictures, a faster CPU isn’t meaningfully relevant if all you do is browse social media and send messages, and screen size, camera lenses and battery capacity all come with trade-offs if they’re improved any further. Even if there are diminishing returns to marginal improvements, though, we all seem happier than ever to spend big sums on the devices in our pockets. Officially, any phone over £600 is “premium”, and the UK is the most premium-focused market in Europe, Samsung’s Pierce says, with about 78% of the market above that price-point – so much so that the “ultra-premium” sector, over £1,000, is 37% of the market in its own right. Those facts, in turn, have pushed device manufacturers to find other ways of improving the offering. One of the most hopeful outcomes, for me, is that the Flip and Fold are emphatically not for everybody. A world where the concept of a “flagship phone” dies away, and we accept that, even at the expensive end of the scale, everyone’s needs are different and the device that is best for them might not be the one that is best for someone else, would be the sort of consumer electronics future I’d like to see.

3,3,"YouTube is to remove videos that spread misinformation about all vaccines, as it steps up a crackdown on harmful content posted during the coronavirus pandemic. From Wednesday, the video streaming site, which has already banned Covid jab falsehoods, will take down content that contains misinformation such as claiming any approved vaccine is dangerous, causes chronic health defects or does not reduce spread of disease. Under previous guidelines, the platform demoted – effectively hiding from view – videos that spread misinformation about non-Covid vaccines or promoted vaccine hesitancy. Last year, YouTube implemented a ban on Covid vaccine misinformation videos, which has led to 130,000 pieces of content being taken down since then. YouTube, which is owned by Google, has removed a total of 1m videos for spreading general Covid falsehoods since the pandemic broke out. Matt Halprin, the global head of trust and safety at YouTube, said vaccine misinformation was a global problem and had spilled over from the spreading of falsehoods about Covid jabs. “Vaccine misinformation appears globally, it appears in all countries and cultures,” he said. Halprin added that falsehoods around the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which has been wrongly attributed to causing autism, were an example of the misinformation YouTube will target. “There is still a lot of challenges around MMR and people arguing whether that causes autism. And as we know, the science is very stable that vaccines do not cause autism,” he said. Halprin said the ban would also apply, for instance, to content that claims vaccines cause cancer, infertility or contain microchips, the latter having gained prominence as a falsehood about Covid jabs. In 2019, a major study affirmed that there was no link between autism and MMR, in the wake of a pre-Covid upsurge in vaccine scepticism, fanned by social media and anti-government populism. A paper in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, which is published by the American College of Physicians, found “no support for the hypothesis of increased risk for autism after MMR vaccination in a nationwide unselected population of Danish children”. Halprin said the new guidelines will still allow personal testimonies on taking vaccines, discussion of vaccine policies and references to historical failures in vaccine programmes, as long as the content does not include broad misinformation or promote vaccine hesitancy. As well as applying to falsehoods about vaccines for specific diseases such as hepatitis, the guidelines will apply to general statements about vaccines that are deemed to be misleading. On Wednesday, a search under the terms “MMR vaccine autism” produced a page of results containing rebuttals of any link between the vaccine and autism, including a video entitled “Vaccines and autism: how the myth started”. However, the page also includes a TV interview with the actor Robert De Niro in which he states that Vaxxed, a documentary directed by Andrew Wakefield – one of the key figures in promoting discredited links between MMR and autism – is a film that “people should see”. De Niro was being interviewed in 2016 after his Tribeca film festival pulled a screening of Vaxxed in the wake of a backlash against the film. YouTube’s move follows a decision by Facebook last year to remove false claims about Covid vaccines once they have been debunked by public health experts.","A paper in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, which is published by the American College of Physicians, found “no support for the hypothesis of increased risk for autism after MMR vaccination in a nationwide unselected population of Danish children”.

4,4,"Mark Zuckerberg has hit back at the testimony of the Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, saying her claims the company puts profit over people’s safety are “just not true”. In a blogpost, the Facebook founder and chief executive addressed one of the most damaging statements in Haugen’s opening speech to US senators on Tuesday, that Facebook puts “astronomical profits before people”. “At the heart of these accusations is this idea that we prioritise profit over safety and wellbeing. That’s just not true,” he said. He added: “The argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical. We make money from ads, and advertisers consistently tell us they don’t want their ads next to harmful or angry content.” Zuckerberg said many of the claims made by Haugen – and in the Wall Street Journal, based on documents she leaked – “don’t make any sense”. The most damaging reporting in the WSJ, reiterated at length by Haugen in testimony to the US Senate on Tuesday, was that Facebook failed to act on internal research showing that its Instagram app was damaging teenagers’ mental health. “Many of the claims don’t make any sense. If we wanted to ignore research, why would we create an industry-leading research program to understand these important issues in the first place?” he said. Responding to Haugen’s claims that Facebook’s attempts to limit harmful content were constantly hampered by a shortage of staff, he said: “If we didn’t care about fighting harmful content, then why would we employ so many more people dedicated to this than any other company in our space – even ones larger than us? If we wanted to hide our results, why would we have established an industry-leading standard for transparency and reporting on what we’re doing?” Haugen’s testimony, and accompanying statements by US senators in the hearing, repeatedly questioned whether Facebook could be trusted. “Facebook has not earned a right to just have blind trust in them,” said Haugen, a former Facebook employee who worked on the company’s unit monitoring electoral interference before she quit in May. Zuckerberg said a change to Facebook’s News Feed algorithm in 2018 was implemented because it increased wellbeing. According to Haugen, internal Facebook research showed that the change to News Feed – a customised scroll of content that is a core part of Facebook users’ interaction with the platform – had amplified divisive content. Zuckerberg said: “This change showed fewer viral videos and more content from friends and family – which we did knowing it would mean people spent less time on Facebook, but that research suggested it was the right thing for people’s wellbeing. Is that something a company focused on profits over people would do?” Addressing company staff in the Facebook post, made late on Tuesday, Zuckerberg said he expected many employees would not recognise the business portrayed in the WSJ coverage and Haugen’s testimony. “I’m sure many of you have found the recent coverage hard to read because it just doesn’t reflect the company we know,” he wrote. “We care deeply about issues like safety, wellbeing and mental health. It’s difficult to see coverage that misrepresents our work and our motives. At the most basic level, I think most of us just don’t recognize the false picture of the company that is being painted.” Zuckerberg opened the post with a reference to Monday’s platform outage when the company’s services – including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp platforms – went offline for nearly six hours. Facebook has 3.5 billion monthly active users across its platforms including Instagram and WhatsApp. “The deeper concern with an outage like this isn’t how many people switch to competitive services or how much money we lose, but what it means for the people who rely on our services to communicate with loved ones, run their businesses, or support their communities,” he said.","The most damaging reporting in the WSJ, reiterated at length by Haugen in testimony to the US Senate on Tuesday, was that Facebook failed to act on internal research showing that its Instagram app was damaging teenagers’ mental health.

5,5,"Government sources have rowed back on Boris Johnson’s apparent commitment to criminal sanctions for tech company bosses who fail to tackle harmful or illegal content. However, the Guardian understands that the new culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, who has first-hand experience of online abuse, is minded to take a tougher approach on sanctions than her predecessor Oliver Dowden, though she is still taking advice. During prime minister’s questions, Johnson appeared to agree with Keir Starmer that the delayed online harms bill would include a commitment to possible criminal sanctions. The proposals already include deferred powers on new criminal offence and the bill already contains the power to issue fines, but any change to immediately implement criminal sanctions would be a significant hardening of the proposals. Johnson promised to present the bill to parliament before Christmas in the wake of the killing of Sir David Amess. That prospect was also later played down by Whitehall sources, saying that would give them just five days to re-draft the bill between the pre-legislative scrutiny committee reporting and the bill being presented. Pressed by Starmer on what measures he would take, Johnson agreed with the idea of a cross-party approach but also peppered his responses with partisan criticisms, prompting some shouts of complaint in the Commons. Starmer began his questions by noting the tributes to Amess, the veteran Conservative backbencher who was stabbed to death at a constituency surgery on Friday, given by MPs from all parties in the Commons on Monday. “I want to see if we can use that collaborative spirit to make progress on one of the issues that was raised on Monday – tackling violent extremism,” Starmer said, asking about progress for the online safety bill, first mooted three years ago. Starmer said: “Will the prime minister build on the desire shown by this house on Monday to get things done, and commit to bringing forward the second reading of the online safety bill by the end of this calendar year? If he does, we’ll support it.” Johnson replied by initially pledging the bill would complete all its stages before Christmas, before correcting himself – seemingly at the prompting of the home secretary, Priti Patel, who was sitting next to him – to say he would “bring it forward before Christmas in the way that he suggests – and I’m delighted that he is offering his support”. Starmer then pressed on potential changes to the proposed bill, saying: “Tough sanctions are clearly needed, yet under the government’s current proposals, directors of platforms failing to crack down on extremism would still not face criminal sanctions. Why is that?” In a later answer, Johnson appeared to agree to this, saying: “And yes, of course we will have criminal sanctions with tough sentences for those who are responsible for allowing this foul content to permeate the internet.”","The proposals already include deferred powers on new criminal offence and the bill already contains the power to issue fines, but any change to immediately implement criminal sanctions would be a significant hardening of the proposals.

6,6,"Facebook has admitted core parts of its platform appear hardwired for spreading misinformation and divisive content, according to a fresh wave of internal documents that showed the social media company struggled to contain hate speech in the developing world and was reluctant to censor rightwing US news organisations. An internal memo warned that Facebook’s “core product mechanics”, or the basics of how the product worked, had let hate speech and misinformation grow on the platform. The memo added that the basic functions of Facebook were “not neutral”. “We also have compelling evidence that our core product mechanics, such as vitality, recommendations, and optimizing for engagement, are a significant part of why these types of speech flourish on the platform,” said the 2019 memo. Referring to Facebook’s safety unit, the document added: “If integrity takes a hands-off stance for these problems, whether for technical (precision) or philosophical reasons, then the net result is that Facebook, taken as a whole, will be actively (if not necessarily consciously) promoting these types of activities. The mechanics of our platform are not neutral.” The document was disclosed by the New York Times on Monday as part of a wave of stories by a US-led consortium of news organisations. The NYT stories, and others, were based on disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission – the US financial watchdog – and provided to Congress in redacted form by the former Facebook employee turned whistleblower Frances Haugen’s legal counsel. The redacted versions were obtained by a consortium of news organisations, including the NYT, Bloomberg, Politico and the Washington Post. The documents have also been obtained by the Wall Street Journal, which since last month has published a series of damaging exposés about Facebook. Other stories released on Monday as part of the Facebook Papers referred to Facebook’s inability to tackle hate speech and harmful content outside the US. Incitement to hatred and disinformation is substantially worse among non-English-speaking users, according to multiple reports by the Facebook Papers partners. Much of Facebook’s moderation infrastructure is underresourced for languages other than English, and its software struggles to understand certain dialects of Arabic, the Associated Press (AP) reported. The company’s algorithmic moderation software could only identify 0.2% of harmful material in Afghanistan, according to an internal report carried out this year that was reported by Politico. The remainder of the harmful material had to be flagged by staff, even though the company lacked moderators who could speak Pashto or Dari, the country’s principal languages. Tools for reporting harmful material in the country were only available in English, despite it not being widely spoken in Afghanistan. According to another document, Apple threatened to remove Facebook and Instagram from its App Store two years ago over concerns the platforms were being used to trade in domestic servants, a sector with a high risk of abuse and slavery. The threat was dropped after Facebook shared details of its attempts to tackle the problem. One internal document showed how Facebook removed more than 1,000 accounts operating largely out of Saudi Arabia to recruit workers, who reported abuse and sexual violence. “In our investigation, domestic workers frequently complained to their recruitment agencies of being locked in their homes, starved, forced to extend their contracts indefinitely, unpaid, and repeatedly sold to other employers without their consent,” one Facebook document read. “In response, agencies commonly told them to be more agreeable.” The report added: “We also found recruitment agencies dismissing more serious crimes, such as physical or sexual assault, rather than helping domestic workers.” Within the files disclosed by Haugen are testimonies from dozens of Facebook employees frustrated by the company’s failure to either acknowledge the harms it generates, or to properly support efforts to mitigate or prevent those harms. “We’re FB, not some naive startup. With the unprecedented resources we have, we should do better,” wrote one employee quoted by Politico in the wake of the 6 January 2021 attack on the US capitol. “Never forget the day Trump rode down the escalator in 2015, called for a ban on Muslims entering the US, we determined that it violated our policies, and yet we explicitly overrode the policy and didn’t take the video down,” wrote another. “There is a straight line that can be drawn from that day to today, one of the darkest days in the history of democracy … History will not judge us kindly.” Elsewhere in the papers, a document seen by the Financial Times showed a Facebook employee claiming Facebook’s public policy team blocked decisions to take down posts “when they see that they could harm powerful political actors”. The memo said moves to take down content by repeat offenders against Facebook’s guidelines, such as rightwing publishers, were often reversed because the publishers might retaliate. “In the US it appears that interventions have been almost exclusively on behalf of conservative publishers,” said the memo, referring to companies such as Breitbart and PragerU. Speaking in an earnings call with investors on Monday, Zuckerberg spoke to the document leak but did not address the contents directly, saying the issues the company is facing “aren’t primarily about social media” but relating to “polarization [that] started rising in the US before I was born”. “My view on what we are seeing is a coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to create a false picture about our company,” he added, as the company reported a quarterly profit of $9bn. A Facebook spokesperson said: “At the heart of these stories is a premise which is false. Yes, we’re a business and we make profit, but the idea that we do so at the expense of people’s safety or wellbeing misunderstands where our own commercial interests lie. The truth is we’ve invested $13bn and have over 40,000 people to do one job: keep people safe on Facebook.” Kari Paul contributed reporting","“In response, agencies commonly told them to be more agreeable.” The report added: “We also found recruitment agencies dismissing more serious crimes, such as physical or sexual assault, rather than helping domestic workers.” Within the files disclosed by Haugen are testimonies from dozens of Facebook employees frustrated by the company’s failure to either acknowledge the harms it generates, or to properly support efforts to mitigate or prevent those harms. “Never forget the day Trump rode down the escalator in 2015, called for a ban on Muslims entering the US, we determined that it violated our policies, and yet we explicitly overrode the policy and didn’t take the video down,” wrote another. “There is a straight line that can be drawn from that day to today, one of the darkest days in the history of democracy … History will not judge us kindly.” Elsewhere in the papers, a document seen by the Financial Times showed a Facebook employee claiming Facebook’s public policy team blocked decisions to take down posts “when they see that they could harm powerful political actors”.

7,7,"Facebook has been at the centre of a wave of damaging revelations after a whistleblower released tens of thousands of internal documents and testified about the company’s inner workings to US senators. Frances Haugen left Facebook in May with a cache of memos and research that have exposed the inner workings of the company and the impact its platforms have on users. The first stories based on those documents were published by the Wall Street Journal in September. Haugen gave further evidence about Facebook’s failure to act on harmful content in testimony to US senators on 5 October, in which she accused the company of putting “astronomical profits before people”. She also testified to MPs and peers in the UK on Monday, as a fresh wave of stories based on the documents was published by a consortium of news organisations. Facebook’s products – the eponymous platform, the Instagram photo-sharing app, Facebook Messenger and the WhatsApp messaging service – are used by 2.8 billion people a day and the company generated a net income – a US measure of profit – of $29bn (£21bn) last year. Here is what we have learned from the documents, and Haugen, since the revelations first broke last month. Teenage mental health The most damaging revelations focused on Instagram’s impact on the mental health and wellbeing of teenage girls. One piece of internal research showed that for teenage girls already having “hard moments”, one in three found Instagram made body issues worse. A further slide shows that one in three people who were finding social media use problematic found Instagram made it worse, with one in four saying it made issues with social comparison worse. Facebook described reports on the research, by the WSJ in September, as a “mischaracterisation” of its internal work. Nonetheless, the Instagram research has galvanised politicians on both sides of the Atlantic seeking to rein in Facebook. Violence in developing countries Haugen has warned that Facebook is fanning ethnic violence in countries including Ethiopia and is not doing enough to stop it. She said that 87% of the spending on combating misinformation at Facebook is spent on English content when only 9% of users are English speakers. According to the news site Politico on Monday, just 6% of Arabic-language hate content was detected on Instagram before it made its way on to the platform. Haugen told Congress on 5 October that Facebook’s use of engagement-based ranking – where the platform ranks a piece of content, and whether to put it in front of users, on the amount of interactions it gets off people – was endangering lives. “Facebook … knows, they have admitted in public, that engagement-based ranking is dangerous without integrity and security systems, but then not rolled out those integrity and security systems to most of the languages in the world. And that’s what is causing things like ethnic violence in Ethiopia,” she said. Divisive algorithm changes In 2018 Facebook changed the way it tailored content for users of its news feed feature, a key part of people’s experience of the platform. The emphasis on boosting “meaningful social interactions” between friends and family meant that the feed leant towards reshared material, which was often misinformed and toxic. “Misinformation, toxicity and violent content are inordinately prevalent among reshares,” said internal research. Facebook said it had an integrity team that was tackling the problematic content “as efficiently as possible”. Tackling falsehoods about the US presidential election The New York Times reported that internal research showed how, at one point after the US presidential election last year, 10% of all US views of political material on Facebook – a very high proportion for the platform – were of posts alleging that Joe Biden’s victory was fraudulent. One internal review criticised attempts to tackle “Stop the Steal” groups spreading claims that the election was rigged. “Enforcement was piecemeal,” said the research. The revelations have reignited concerns about Facebook’s role in the 6 January riots. Facebook said: “The responsibility for the violence that occurred … lies with those who attacked our Capitol and those who encouraged them.” However, the WSJ has also reported that Facebook’s automated systems were taking down posts generating only an estimated 3-5% of total views of hate speech. Disgruntled Facebook staff Within the files disclosed by Haugen are testimonies from dozens of Facebook employees frustrated by the company’s failure to either acknowledge the harms it generates, or to properly support efforts to mitigate or prevent those harms. “We are FB, not some naive startup. With the unprecedented resources we have, we should do better,” wrote one employee quoted by Politico in the wake of the 6 January attack on the US capitol. “Never forget the day Trump rode down the escalator in 2015, called for a ban on Muslims entering the US, we determined that it violated our policies, and yet we explicitly overrode the policy and didn’t take the video down,” wrote another. “There is a straight line that can be drawn from that day to today, one of the darkest days in the history of democracy … History will not judge us kindly.” Facebook is struggling to recruit young users A section of a complaint filed by Haugen’s lawyers with the US financial watchdog refers to young users in “more developed economies” using Facebook less. This is a problem for a company that relies on advertising for its income because young users, with unformed spending habits, can be lucrative to marketers. The complaint quotes an internal document stating that Facebook’s daily teenage and young adult (18-24) users have “been in decline since 2012-13” and “only users 25 and above are increasing their use of Facebook”. Further research reveals “engagement is declining for teens in most western, and several non-western, countries”. Haugen said engagement was a key metric for Facebook, because it meant users spent longer on the platform, which in turn appealed to advertisers who targeted users with adverts that accounted for $84bn (£62bn) of the company’s $86bn annual revenue. On Monday, Bloomberg said “time spent” for US teenagers on Facebook was down 16% year-on-year, and that young adults in the US were also spending 5% less time on the platform. Facebook is built for divisive content On Monday the NYT reported an internal memo warning that Facebook’s “core product mechanics”, or its basic workings, had let hate speech and misinformation grow on the platform. The memo added that the basic functions of Facebook were “not neutral”. “We also have compelling evidence that our core product mechanics, such as vitality, recommendations and optimising for engagement, are a significant part of why these types of speech flourish on the platform,” said the 2019 memo. A Facebook spokesperson said: “At the heart of these stories is a premise which is false. Yes, we are a business and we make profit, but the idea that we do so at the expense of people’s safety or wellbeing misunderstands where our own commercial interests lie. The truth is we have invested $13bn and have over 40,000 people to do one job: keep people safe on Facebook.” Apple threatened to pull Facebook products from its app store over human trafficking content According to another document in the cache, Apple threatened to remove Facebook and Instagram from its app store two years ago over concerns they were being used to trade in domestic servants, a sector that is high-risk for abuse and human slavery. The threat was dropped after Facebook shared details of its attempts to tackle the problem. One internal document showed how Facebook removed over 1,000 accounts operating largely out of Saudi Arabia to recruit workers, who reported abuse and sexual violence. “In our investigation, domestic workers frequently complained to their recruitment agencies of being locked in their homes, starved, forced to extend their contracts indefinitely, unpaid, and repeatedly sold to other employers without their consent,” one Facebook document read. “In response, agencies commonly told them to be more agreeable.” Facebook’s crackdown seems to have had a limited effect, according to the AP, which found even today a quick search for “khadima”, or “maids” in Arabic, will bring up accounts featuring posed photographs of Africans and South Asians with ages and prices listed next to their images. The company in a statement told the AP it took the problem seriously, despite the continued spread of ads exploiting foreign workers in the Middle East. Facebook avoids confrontations with US politicians and rightwing news organisations A document seen by the Financial Times showed a Facebook employee claiming Facebook’s public policy team blocked decisions to take down posts “when they see that they could harm powerful political actors”. The document said: “In multiple cases the final judgment about whether a prominent post violates a certain written policy are made by senior executives, sometimes Mark Zuckerberg.” The memo said moves to take down content by repeat offenders against Facebook’s guidelines, such as rightwing publishers, were often reversed because the publishers might retaliate. The wave of stories on Monday were based on disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission – the US financial watchdog – and provided to Congress in redacted form by Haugen’s legal counsel.

8,8,"Facebook and Instagram are to stop allowing advertisers to target users based on their history of posting, reading or liking content related to subjects such as sexual orientation, religion and political beliefs. The social media networks’ parent company, Meta Platforms, said from January it would remove detailed targeting options that let advertisers seek out users based on their interactions with causes, organisations or public figures related to health, race or ethnicity, political affiliation, religion, or sexual orientation. This means, for example, that advertisers can no longer pay to target people who have shown an interest in same-sex marriage or Catholicism. In a blogpost, Graham Mudd, a Meta Platforms vice- president of product marketing, said: “We want to better match people’s evolving expectations of how advertisers may reach them on our platform and address feedback from civil rights experts, policymakers and other stakeholders on the importance of preventing advertisers from abusing the targeting options we make available.” According to research by the Tech Transparency Project, Facebook had been serving ads for weapons accessories and body armour next to inflammatory discussions in militia and “patriot” groups on the platform, even after the 6 January Capitol attack in Washington. Meta generates 98% of its income from advertisers, who are able to target specific demographics and consumers because the company has built up profiles of its users through their online activity. Meta, which also sells adverts on its Messenger app and to third-party apps through its audience network, made $86bn (£64bn) in revenues last year. Nearly 2 billion people use the Facebook app every day. Meta acknowledged that the move could affect political groups and campaigning organisations, many of which use Facebook for fundraising. “Some of our advertising partners have expressed concerns about these targeting options going away because of their ability to help generate positive societal change, while others understand the decision to remove them,” said Mudd, who added that advocacy groups still had options on the platform for reaching people. However, advertisers on Meta platforms can continue to target billions of users based on a range of options such as age, gender, occupation and location. Meta is under scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic over its record on keeping users safe following revelations by the whistleblower Frances Haugen, who has released tens of thousands of internal company documents. In a quarterly report released on Tuesday, Meta said the prevalence of hate speech on Facebook had fallen for the fourth quarter in a row. In the third quarter of 2021, it was 0.03% or 3 views of hate speech per 10,000 views of content, down from 0.05% in the second quarter.","In a blogpost, Graham Mudd, a Meta Platforms vice- president of product marketing, said: “We want to better match people’s evolving expectations of how advertisers may reach them on our platform and address feedback from civil rights experts, policymakers and other stakeholders on the importance of preventing advertisers from abusing the targeting options we make available.” According to research by the Tech Transparency Project, Facebook had been serving ads for weapons accessories and body armour next to inflammatory discussions in militia and “patriot” groups on the platform, even after the 6 January Capitol attack in Washington. “Some of our advertising partners have expressed concerns about these targeting options going away because of their ability to help generate positive societal change, while others understand the decision to remove them,” said Mudd, who added that advocacy groups still had options on the platform for reaching people.

9,9,"Government prosecutors in the trial of Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes ended their case on Friday, capping off 11 weeks of testimony from witnesses detailing allegations of fraud against the founder. The Theranos saga has been widely covered since cracks began to emerge in the glossy image of the blood testing startup in 2015. But the first phase of the trial revealed more startling new details. Investors, former employees and customers chipped away at the successful startup image that Theranos presented during its meteoric rise, instead painting a picture of a chaotic workplace with a founder desperate to succeed – tolerating little dissent amid rising questions about the company’s technologies. Holmes has pleaded not guilty to the charges of defrauding investors and patients . On Friday, Holmes took the stand in her own defense, a risky move that opens her to being grilled in cross examination by the prosecution. Here is what we have learned so far. Former employees: Concerns fell on deaf ears Theranos launched in 2003 and claimed that its proprietary Edison machines could perform hundreds of health tests with just one prick of blood. The company gained momentum, forging partnerships with big names such as Safeway and Walgreens to distribute its tests, raising billions in funding. Amid this spectacular rise, four different lab directors at the company said they had voiced grave concerns about its technological abilities operations. Over six days of questioning, former lab director Adam Rosendorff said he repeatedly expressed doubts about Theranos’ tech to Holmes, but faced “tremendous pressure at the company to show that this technology was successful”. “I had frequent conversations with Elizabeth about concerns that I had in the laboratory,” he testified. Frustrated and disillusioned, he left the company in 2014, he said, noting that when he left he felt “very skeptical” of the Edison machine. Lynette Sawyer and Sunil Dhawan, co-directors of the lab in 2014 and 2015, testified to a disjointed lab operation, noting they never met one another in person and rarely visited the lab or met researchers. They alleged their roles consisted primarily filling out paperwork. “I was very uncomfortable with the lack of clarity about the lab,” Sawyer testified. A fourth former lab director, Kingshuk Das, testified that the Edison devices were returning unusual lab results – turning up prostate-specific antigens for female patients, for example. “I found these instruments to be unsuitable for clinical use,” Das said of the devices. When Das questioned Holmes about the inconsistencies, Das said, the founder became defensive and offered “implausible” explanations as to why the machines were malfunctioning. Investors: Theranos over-promised without showing results Theranos attracted large amounts of funding in part due to high-profile investors, including former secretary of states George Schultz and Henry Kissinger, media tycoon Rupert Murdoch and former defense secretary James Mattis. Several of those investors told the jury about their initial excitement about the company and their growing reservations as red flags piled up. Testifying early in the trial, Mattis said he personally invested $85,000 in Theranos, finding the technology “pretty breathtaking”. He was asked to serve on the company’s board, a request he said he questioned as he was “not a medical person” but agreed to (He was paid $150,000 to serve on the board). Mattis said he ultimately lost faith in the company after the Wall Street Journal revealed Theranos’ testing devices were not actually being used to perform most of the analyses the company offered. “There came a point where I didn’t know what to believe about Theranos any more,” he said. Former estate attorney and Theranos investor, Daniel Mosley, testified how he became enamored with the company’s mission and convinced a number of wealthy clients and contacts to invest in it. His recruits included Walmart’s Walton family and Michigan’s billionaire DeVos family. Along with his own investment of $6m, Mosley brought an estimated $380m to Theranos. Several other financial backers of Theranos told the jury they were troubled by the extensive secrecy around the company’s operations, which made it difficult to properly vet whether it was a smart investment. Meanwhile, they reported a pressure to get in on a much-hyped opportunity before it was too late. Lisa Peterson, who handles investments for the DeVos family, said she feared Holmes would ice her out if she asked too many questions about the company. “We were very careful not to circumvent things and upset Elizabeth,” she said. “If we did too much, we wouldn’t be invited back to invest.” Drug companies and other business partners: We were manipulated Among the most shocking allegations in the trial so far was the prosecution’s accusations that Theranos used false and misleading documents implying that external labs had vetted the products – when in reality they had not – to promote its Edison tests to potential partners. Walgreens CFO Wade Miquelon revealed during his testimony that Holmes had implied drug firms Pfizer and Schering-Plough had validated the company’s blood-testing technology. Holmes, Miquelon said, shared with investors and potential partners a document carrying the Pfizer logo, purportedly showing the pharmaceutical company’s support. But the document had been forged, the prosecution claims. “Pfizer did not write this,” prosecutor Robert Leach said in opening arguments for the trial. “Pfizer did not put its logo on this. Pfizer did not give its permission to put its logo on this. Pfizer did not make the conclusions in this report.” Trusting such reports, Miquelon said, Walgreens made a $140m deal with Theranos in 2013 and launched testing in 40 stores across Arizona and California. That partnership fell apart over the next year and Walgreens ultimately sued Theranos in 2016, settling for $25m. Meanwhile, scientists at the pharmaceutical companies Holmes claimed had endorsed Theranos, told the jury they had repeatedly expressed doubts. Former Schering-Plough director Constance Cullen said when vetting Theranos technology in 2009, she found Holmes to be “cagey” and indirect in answering technical questions. She was left “dissatisfied” and ceased responding to emails from Holmes. Similarly Shane Weber, a former Pfizer scientist, said he was left feeling unsettled by an interview with Holmes in 2008 to assess a potential partnership. “[Theranos] provided non-informative, tangential, deflective or evasive answers”, Weber wrote in a report referenced during the trial, testifying that he recommended Pfizer halt potential partnerships with the company. What’s next Holmes stayed silent in the court room during prosecutors’ presentation of the case, writing notes by hand in a notebook, flanked occasionally by supporters including husband, Billy Evans, and her mother. She took the stand on Friday, laying out the trajectory of the startup, and testifying that she believed Theranos had developed technology capable of running any blood test. “We worked for years with teams of scientists and engineers to miniaturize all the technologies in the laboratory,” she said, testifying for about five hours before the court closed for the day. Holmes’s decision to testify is a risky one, since it means she’ll face cross examination from the prosecution. Holmes’s legal team is expected to argue in the coming weeks that Holmes made decisions in good faith and did not purposely deceive investors and customers. “Theranos failed for a lot of reasons, but it failed in part because it made mistakes,” Lance Wade, a defense lawyer for Holmes, said during opening statements. “Ms Holmes made mistakes, but mistakes are not crimes. A failed business does not make a CEO a criminal.” Early court filings indicated the defense may also use an argument that Sunny Balwani, Holmes’s former boyfriend and Theranos co-executive, abused and controlled her, influencing her to commit fraud. Balwani faces his own trial on charges similar to Holmes’s in 2022. Holmes faces a maximum of 20 years in prison. Jurors could come to a verdict before the year’s end. Legal teams for Elizabeth Holmes and Sunny Balwani did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.","He was asked to serve on the company’s board, a request he said he questioned as he was “not a medical person” but agreed to (He was paid $150,000 to serve on the board).

10,10,"The executive producer behind blockbusters including Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman is to make Hollywood’s first feature film funded entirely by non-fungible tokens (NFTs), with a promise that those who invest will get a share of any profits and meet the stars of the production. Niels Juul, who has set up the production company NFT Studios to fund a series of films, hopes to raise between $8m and $10m (£6m and £7.5m) through the sale of 10,000 NFTs to the public and institutional investors. NFTs are a digital certificate proving that you own something, in this case part of a film. They have become a hot new financial trend lauded by some as a gold rush and regarded by others as the latest bubble, with a risk investors could be left out of pocket. Juul said the aim was to develop a new funding model for films to circumvent an antiquated Hollywood system under which smaller productions take up to eight years to reach movie or TV screens. “As a producer my biggest frustration is from the finance side, it is an ordeal,” he said. “The studios are mainly doing big franchise films, an independent film can take years and years. It’s hard getting investors for films and productions, especially at development stage, with the Hollywood system.

11,11,"Facebook has banned seven “surveillance-for-hire” companies from its platforms and will send warning notices to 48,000 people who the company believes were targeted by malicious activity, following a months-long investigation into the “cyber mercenary” industry. The social media company said on Thursday that its investigation had revealed new details about the way the surveillance companies enable their clients to “indiscriminately” target people across the internet to collect intelligence about them, manipulate them – and ultimately compromise their devices. Among the surveillance companies that Facebook named in its investigation and banned from its platforms are: Black Cube, an Israeli company that gained notoriety after it emerged that the disgraced media mogul and convicted sex offender Harvey Weinstein had hired them to target women who had accused him of abuse. Black Cube rejected Facebook’s claims about its activities. Cobwebs, another Israeli company that Facebook said enabled its clients to use public websites and dark web sites to trick targets into revealing personal information. The company also reportedly works for US clients, including a local police department in Hartford, Connecticut. Cytrox, a North Macedonian company that Facebook said enabled its clients to infect targets with malware following phishing campaigns. The investigation conducted by Facebook comes as the company is itself facing intense scrutiny in Washington and around the world following accusations by a whistleblower, Frances Haugen, that it enabled the spread of hate speech and disinformation. The Facebook investigation is significant, however, because it reveals new details about the way parts of the surveillance industry use social media – from Facebook to Instagram – to create fake accounts to deceive their targets and conceal their own activities. While many of the companies claim that they are hired to target criminals and terrorists, Facebook said the industry “regularly” enabled its clients to target journalists, dissidents, critics of authoritarian regimes and human rights activists and their families. “Our hope is to contribute to the broader understanding of the harms this industry represents worldwide and call on the democratic governments to take further steps to help protect people and impose oversight on the sellers of ubiquitous spyware,” the company said. It added that it had not only removed the companies’ fake accounts from their platforms, but also issued cease and desist orders and would work to ensure that the companies did not seek to re-engage on their platforms. Facebook said that not all of the 48,000 who would be alerted were hacked, though the company did believe they were the subject of “malicious activity”. It also pointed to recent and intense media focus on NSO Group, the Israeli spyware maker that was at the heart of the Pegasus Project, an investigation by the Guardian and other media outlets, and was recently blacklisted by the Biden administration. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook’s parent company, Meta, sued NSO in 2019 and has been a leading critic of the company. NSO is not among the companies banned on Thursday. “It’s important to realize that NSO is only one piece of a much broader global cyber mercenary ecosystem,” Facebook said. As Facebook announced its investigation, leading researchers at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto released a new report that zeroed in on one entity – Cytrox – whose spyware, called Predator, is alleged to have been used by an unknown client to hack the devices of two individuals. One, Ayman Nour, is an exiled Egyptian politician who Citizen Lab said was found to have simultaneously been hacked by two different nation-state clients, one using Predator and another using Pegasus. Nour, who is based in Turkey, is the president of an Egyptian political opposition group called Union of the Egyptian National Forces and was a former presidential candidate who ran against former president Hosni Mubarak. He was imprisoned for four years after his run over allegations – which were seen as being politically motivated – of forging signatures for petitions. He was released following international pressure. He was also an associate of Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist who was murdered by Saudi agents in the Saudi consulate in 2018. In an interview with the Guardian, Nour said it was painful to learn he had been hacked. “There was a negative psychological impact on me. My kids live in the UK and US, and I live in a third country, Turkey, so being sure I was being spied on, I stopped communicating with my sons, because I fear for them,” he said. Nour said that he had held a Zoom meeting with Egyptians, Saudis and Emirates as part of a discussion about the use of the death penalty in Arab countries on the day researchers later learned he had been hacked. A second target, who has remained anonymous, was described by Citizen Lab as an exiled journalist and outspoken critic of the Abdel Fatah al-Sisi regime. Cytrox did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Internal scans by Citizen Lab found likely Predator customers in Armenia, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Madagascar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Serbia. Cytrox is reportedly part of Intellexa, the “Star Alliance” of spyware which was formed to compete with NSO and describes itself on its website as being EU-based and regulated. Intellexa did not respond to a request for comment. An NSO spokesperson said it had not seen the Citizen Lab report but said the claims were “technologically and contractually illogical” because Egypt was on NSO’s “no-sale” list and was not a customer and “will never be one”. “The use of cyber tools in order to monitor dissents, activists and journalists is a severe misuse of any technology and goes against the desired use of such critical tools. The international community should have zero tolerance policy towards such acts, therefore a global regulation needed. NSO has proven in the past it’s zero-tolerance for these types of misuse, by terminating contracts,” the spokesperson said. Previous reporting by the Pegasus Project has shown that NSO has previously maintained certain customers, including the UAE, despite allegations of abuse. The company has indicated that it has cut ties with some clients, including Saudi Arabia and UAE following allegations of abuse. Citizen Lab said Cytrox reportedly began as a North Macedonian startup and has a corporate presence in Israel and Hungary. In its report, Facebook said it removed 300 accounts on Facebook and Instagram linked to Cytrox. It said investigations with Citizen Lab had found a “vast domain infrastructure” that it believed Cytrox used to spoof legitimate news entities in their countries of interest. In its threat report, it described three stages clients of most of the companies it investigated use to target individuals. First, the reconnaissance stage, which involves “surveillance from a distance” to discern an individuals interests. Second is what Facebook calls an “engagement stage”, in which companies’ clients then establish contact with targets and seek to build trust and solicit information, and “trick them” into clicking on links and downloading files. Finally, Facebook said the final move involves “hacking for hire”, in which individuals are hacked or otherwise targeted by malware. The company said that it was important to focus and disrupt the first two stages of invasive surveillance, which have gotten less attention in media reports. In the case of Black Cube, Facebook said it removed 300 Facebook and Instagram accounts linked to the company. “Black Cube operated fictitious personas tailored for its targets: some of them posed as graduate students, NGO and human rights workers, and film and TV producers,” Facebook said. In a statement, Black Cube – which has apologised publicly for its work for Weinstein – said: “Black Cube does not undertake any phishing or hacking and does not operate in the cyber world. Black Cube is a litigation support firm which uses legal Humint investigation methods to obtain information for litigations and arbitrations. Black Cube works with the world’s leading law firms in proving bribery, uncovering corruption, and recovering hundreds of millions in stolen assets. Black Cube obtains legal advice in every jurisdiction in which we operate in order to ensure that all our agents’ activities are fully compliant with local laws.” Other entities banned by Facebook include: Cognyte, Bluehawk CI, BellTroX and what was described as an “unknown entity” in China, which it said was responsible for malicious targeting and appears to have been used for domestic law enforcement in China. The malware deployed by the group was used against minority groups in Xinjiang, Myanmar and Hong Kong. BellTroX could not be reached for comment. A Cobwebs spokesperson told Reuters that the company drew on open sources and that its products “are not intrusive by any means”. The other entities named by Facebook did not respond to requests for comment.","The investigation conducted by Facebook comes as the company is itself facing intense scrutiny in Washington and around the world following accusations by a whistleblower, Frances Haugen, that it enabled the spread of hate speech and disinformation. “Our hope is to contribute to the broader understanding of the harms this industry represents worldwide and call on the democratic governments to take further steps to help protect people and impose oversight on the sellers of ubiquitous spyware,” the company said.

12,12,"Twenty years ago today, a tech startup called Nupedia launched a side project. The company had been hard at work producing a free online encyclopaedia, but it was slow going: its strict editing process, comprehensive peer review and focus on expert authors meant it finished only 21 articles in its first year. The side project would do away with all of that. Instead, anyone would be able to write and edit articles. Nupedia’s founders were split over whether the trade-off – more content with a lower barrier to entry – was worth it, but by the end of its first year, the side project had amassed articles on more than 18,000 topics. Nupedia, by the time it shut in 2003, had finished just 25. That side project, Wikipedia, now has more than 55m articles across 300 languages. With 1.7bn unique visitors a month, it is the 13th most popular website on the internet, according to Amazon’s monitoring site, Alexa Internet, and the only one in the top 50 to be run on an entirely non-commercial basis (bbc.co.uk just outranks it among UK users). The encyclopaedia’s foundational model attracted criticism from day one. Without experts writers or professional editors, many wondered, how could it ensure accuracy? By 2006, as the site celebrated its fifth anniversary, it was the subject of mockery in the mainstream press. One article cited the encyclopaedia’s claim that “David Beckham was a Chinese goalkeeper in the 18th century” to highlight a “comedy of errors”. Even in 2006, that particular piece of vandalism was fixed within 11 minutes. These days, Wikipedia has a few more tools to prevent such abuse. The article about Beckham is one of many that is “semi-protected”, a status that prevents unregistered users from editing it – a concession to the reality that not everyone on the internet is interested in contributing to a collective endeavour. But as the site continues to flourish even as the online environment has transformed, it raises a different set of questions from those of its early doubters. Wikipedia, as one joke goes, works in practice, which is good, because it definitely doesn’t work in theory. Why has the site succeeded in building a positive online community where so many others have failed? Jimmy Wales, its co-founder, cites two things as making the key difference. “First, everyone knows what an encyclopedia is. If I say ‘encyclopedia article about the Eiffel Tower’, we all know what that should be, so if we set out to write that, we know where we are going and what it should be like. Second, we never regarded Wikipedia as a wide-open free speech forum, it’s a project to build an encyclopedia. So we try to avoid (as much as we can, we are humans) the typical round and round flame wars of social media.” “Wikipedia has issues in the same way that any large institution has issues, but it’s undoubtedly a remarkable achievement,” says Abigail Brady, a long-term editor on the site. “In some ways it’s a relic – it dates from a pre-social media era of the web where idealistic attempts to create large collaborative works were just starting. “I think the key to its long-term success has been its lack of commercialisation. Jimmy Wales made a decision that Wikipedia should be non-profit very early on, and stuck to it. There are no ads (beyond the odd pledge drive), and no sense that your labour is being farmed by a company too cheapskate to actually pay people to do data entry. It is a genuine collaborative project.” As Wikipedia has grown, it has moved beyond simple encyclopaedia-style articles. The community’s best points are now visible at times of great upheaval, when collaborative editing allows hundreds of people to work on pulling together an authoritative overview of breaking news events before the events have even finished. At 6.34pm UK time on 6 January this year, one Wikipedia editor, with the username Another Believer, decided that events in Washington looked important enough to warrant an article. Tentatively titled “January 2021 Donald Trump rally”, the initial entry was brief: “On 6 January 2021, thousands of Donald Trump supporters gathered in Washington DC to reject results of the November 2020 presidential election.” One minute later, the Guardian’s live blog reported: “House offices evacuated as Trump supporters storm Capitol barriers.” Over the next half-hour, Another Believer continued to update their article alone. Slowly, other administrators began to join in, and the article became the site’s key focus for those documenting the rapidly evolving events in Washington. By midnight UK time, the article was 3,000 words long, with a further 3,000 words of footnotes, and a debate was raging over whether to rename it from its latest title, “2021 United States Capitol protests”, to its current headline, “2021 storming of the United States Capitol”. The collaborative encyclopaedia still has many barriers to overcome, from an ever-present funding crisis, only partially solved by its donation-driven revenue model, to its undesired role as a silent battlefield for professionally run influence campaigns to rehabilitate reputations, or excise controversy from the internet. And it still faces the same pressures that more conventional reference sources do, as it struggles to represent the history of the world with less of a focus on the white, male wealthy figures who make up so much of recorded history. But 20 years on, it is difficult to deny that Wikipedia has proved the naysayers wrong. Whether it is the last gasp of a vision of the internet that has all but died out, or a shining beacon lighting the way to a better future, remains to be seen.","With 1.7bn unique visitors a month, it is the 13th most popular website on the internet, according to Amazon’s monitoring site, Alexa Internet, and the only one in the top 50 to be run on an entirely non-commercial basis (bbc.co.uk just outranks it among UK users).

13,13,"The biggest companies in technology love an ultimatum but rarely do they spell out their threats. This week, however, Google has done exactly that, telling an Australian parliamentary hearing that a proposed law forcing the company to pay news publishers for the right to link to their content “would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia”. The threat, from the company’s Australian managing director, Mel Silva, is the latest escalation in a war of words over the proposal, which seeks to undo some of the damage online business models have dealt to the country’s publishing industry. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, told a press conference “we don’t respond to threats”. But Google’s warning is hardly unusual in an industry that is loathe to encourage countries to go it alone when it comes to sweeping regulation. Last September, for example, Facebook told an Irish court that it may have to pull out of the European market entirely if a court judgment banning data flows between the US and UK was upheld. “In the event that [Facebook] were subject to a complete suspension of the transfer of users’ data to the US,” the company’s associate general counsel argued, “it is not clear … how, in those circumstances, it could continue to provide the Facebook and Instagram services in the EU.” Similarly, tech companies have been warning for years that a UK attempt to regulate end-to-end encryption could lead to their messaging services being unfeasible to offer in Britain. But rarely do governments hold their nerve for long enough for the threats to be uttered loudly and clearly. Facebook, for instance, rowed back its warning to the Irish court in press statements, saying it was merely “setting out the simple reality”; and those messaging services are happy to mutter warnings in private, but have not yet seen the need to stick their head above the parapet for a knock-down battle. Australia, though, has a knack for picking fights. It already had one such standoff with Amazon after sales tax changes in 2018 meant the company refused to ship imports to Australia in order to avoid collecting tax on those purchases. But that felt like a win-win for some Australians, closing a tax loophole and boosting local retailers at the same time. The loss of Google’s search engine may be felt more keenly. Google has followed through on similar threats in the past. Spanish users cannot access Google News to this day, after a law in the country intended to force Google to pay newspapers for excerpting links and headlines instead resulted in the company simply removing its news product. The Australian law, by contrast, seeks to avoid Google taking the easy way out. By requiring payments for any links to news, even on the main search engine – and by covering Facebook as well – the country hopes to succeed in extracting revenue from Google, regardless of its threats. Unfortunately for Google, the company has a bad poker face. Even as it was warning Australian senators that it would have to pull out of the country rather than pay the newly levied fee, on the other side of the world in France, Google had agreed to do just that. In an agreement signed between Google France and the industrial body representing the country’s news industry, Google will pay licensing fees to individual news publishers to reuse their material online. Backed by France’s strong copyright protections for the news industry, Google had already negotiated with a few publishers, including Le Monde, but the new agreement sets a blanket precedent. “Withdrawing our services from Australia is the last thing that Google want to have happen, especially when there is another way forward,” Silva told Australian senators on Friday. It might pretend it has not, but in France the company has already discovered that other way forward. And thanks to Google Translate, you don’t even need to speak French to read it for yourself. In a statement, Google later said: “We have offered (and agreed) similar deals for News Showcase in Australia as in France and many other countries around the world. In Australia, it’s not about the money; it’s about being asked to pay for all links and snippets which the European Copyright Directive does not. Links and snippets are the building blocks of the free and open web. Sir Tim Berners Lee in his submission agrees.” Note: Guardian Australia has been in discussion with Google over inclusion in its new “Showcase” offering that would see the company pay news providers for inclusion in this product.","The threat, from the company’s Australian managing director, Mel Silva, is the latest escalation in a war of words over the proposal, which seeks to undo some of the damage online business models have dealt to the country’s publishing industry. “In the event that [Facebook] were subject to a complete suspension of the transfer of users’ data to the US,” the company’s associate general counsel argued, “it is not clear … how, in those circumstances, it could continue to provide the Facebook and Instagram services in the EU.” Similarly, tech companies have been warning for years that a UK attempt to regulate end-to-end encryption could lead to their messaging services being unfeasible to offer in Britain.

14,14,"Facebook has banned misinformation about all vaccines following years of harmful, unfounded health claims proliferating on its platform. As part of its policy on Covid-19-related misinformation, Facebook will now remove posts with false claims about all vaccines, the company announced in a blogpost on Monday. These new community guidelines apply to user-generated posts as well as paid advertisements, which were already banned from including such misinformation. Instagram users will face the same restrictions. “We will begin enforcing this policy immediately, with a particular focus on Pages, groups and accounts that violate these rules,” said Guy Rosen, who oversees content decisions. “We’ll continue to expand our enforcement over the coming weeks.” Groups on Facebook have been known to create echo chambers of misinformation and have fueled the rise of anti-vaccine communities and rhetoric. Under the new policy, groups where users repeatedly share banned content will be shut down. Facebook has repeatedly updated its policies on Covid-19 content as the pandemic has evolved. In April 2020, it began to add to posts about coronavirus a panel of facts from the CDC to combat misinformation. It often made misinformation about vaccines less visible on its platform but stopped short of removing it. This began to change in December, when the company strengthened its coronavirus policies and began to remove posts about Covid-19 that had been debunked by public health experts. This included posts suggesting vaccines contain microchips, claims that wearing a face mask does not help prevent the spread of Covid-19, and claims that 5G technology contributes to or causes coronavirus infections. Facebook will now broaden this ban, addressing false claims that Covid-19 is synthetic, that vaccines are not effective at preventing the disease, or that it’s safer to get the disease than to get the vaccine. The ban does not stop at Covid-related content and will also target falsehoods including suggesting vaccines cause autism – a baseless claim made by many in the anti-vax community. Despite the new policy, vaccine misinformation remains on Facebook and Instagram, which Facebook owns. Top search results for “Covid vaccine” on Instagram were still turning up conspiracy theory accounts on Monday morning. Facebook has faced criticism in recent months for its handling of Covid-19 misinformation. In December it allowed a prominent conspiracy theory video to go viral on the platform, and later it failed to successfully remove pages of a prominent anti-vaccine activist who continued to create new accounts after he was banned.

15,15,"Facebook has failed to live up to its promises of creating a “safe” and “error-free” online environment, according to a new lawsuit filed by the press freedom not-for-profit Reporters without Borders. The organization alleged in a court filing on Tuesday that Facebook is guilty of “deceptive commercial practices” for promising users in its terms of service that it would provide “safe, secure and error-free environment”, one that cannot be used to “share anything (…) that is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent”. “The reality is quite different,” Reporters Without Borders said in a statement. “[Facebook] allows disinformation and hate speech to flourish on its network – hatred in general and hatred against journalists – contrary to the claims made in its terms of service and through its ads.” The suit has been filed in France, and names the French and Irish divisions of Facebook. Under European Union law, a business can be sued if it violates Consumer Code, which protects consumers from “deceptive business practices”. Facebook is unlikely to be forced to make substantial long-term change under the new suit, but such practices under EU law are punishable by two years’ imprisonment and a fine of €300,000 ($356,000). However, for larger companies the fine can be as high as 10% of average annual turnover. Facebook made $86bn in 2020, meaning it could be fined up to $8.6bn, or about €7.6bn. The lawsuit cites a variety of research that underscores how Facebook’s failure to put a stop to misinformation has negatively affected EU users and constitutes a deceptive practice. For example, Facebook was recently identified as “the hub of vaccine conspiracy theories” in French-speaking communities by the non-profit anti-disinformation organization First Draft. The lawsuit, according to a draft of the complaint, also cites a report that details billions of interactions with deceptive sites on Facebook. Facebook has announced a number of policies to address misinformation, banning several movements known for spreading false information outright. But reports have shown the application of these policies to be less than perfect. A new report released on Tuesday, conducted by the non-profit advocacy group Avaaz, found that users in hundreds of groups on the platform continued to glorify violence during the 2020 election and in the weeks leading up to the deadly attack on the US Capitol. The report identified 267 pages and groups on Facebook that it said spread violence-glorifying material in the heat of the 2020 election to a combined following of 32 million users. Many of these posts were tied to QAnon, boogaloo and militia movements – groups supposed to be banned on Facebook officially. But despite what Avaaz called “clear violations” of Facebook’s policies, it found that 119 of these pages and groups were still active on the platform as of 18 March. Facebook said late on Monday that of the 119 that Avaaz found, only 18 “actually violated” Facebook’s policies. Four had already been removed before Monday and Facebook has now taken down the remaining 14. The company said in a statement responding to the report that it had done more than any other internet company to stanch the flow of harmful material, citing its bans of “nearly 900 militarized social movements” and the removal of tens of thousands of QAnon pages, groups, and accounts. It added that it was always improving its efforts against misinformation. The Reporters Without Borders lawsuit marks the latest stumbling block for Facebook as its international battles with legislators continue, with legislation in Australia forcing the platform to pay publishers, a privacy lawsuit in Belgium threatening to enforce fines against Facebook for privacy violations, and a growing pile of lawsuits against Facebook in the US. Facebook is also facing pressure from US lawmakers over alleged anti-competitive behavior. One lawsuit, filed against Facebook by a coalition of US attorneys general in December, accuses Facebook of using its power and acquisitions of its rivals to stifle user growth for competing services. A similar suit has been launched by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which is seeking a permanent injunction in federal court that could force Facebook to sell off Instagram and WhatsApp. On Thursday, the company will join other executives in the US to testify about antitrust concerns. The Associated Press contributed to this report","“[Facebook] allows disinformation and hate speech to flourish on its network – hatred in general and hatred against journalists – contrary to the claims made in its terms of service and through its ads.” The suit has been filed in France, and names the French and Irish divisions of Facebook.

16,16,"Covid conspiracy theorists are seeking to profit from the millions of followers they have built up on Instagram during the pandemic by marketing health supplements, wellness courses and juicers to them. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism has identified more than 100 Covid conspiracy accounts promoting products to an audience of almost 6 million people on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. Facebook insists that it is taking more action on health misinformation, but conspiracy channels on the platform are nevertheless growing in popularity. In the first three months of this year the 100 accounts gained almost a million followers between them. This potentially puts the US tech giant in breach of its undertaking to the UK government last November that it would work to stop users profiting from coronavirus vaccine misinformation online. The tracked accounts included a group of Instagrammers called Health Freedom for Humanity (HFFH). The group’s executive director and cofounder is Alec Zeck, a 28-year-old serving US army captain and Olympic-level handball player. Zeck’s 85,000-follower Instagram page hosts a range of misleading claims, including that the Covid-19 virus has never been isolated. His account promotes HFFH, but also points to a page on linktr.ee, a startup used extensively by Instagrammers to direct users to other resources, sponsors and products for sale. On his linktr.ee page, Zeck promotes a “mind/body/spirit” site selling merchandise and points users to a website for Coseva “heavy metal detox”, selling $95 bottles of a spray that claims to cleanse the body and brain of heavy metals. The page names a “sponsor” – Kylee Zeck, Alec’s wife – who takes a cut of sales. Zeck said: “Our organisation comprises people from all walks of life united in our belief that mandated medical procedures of any kind, medical coercion, or restrictions on health choice violate basic human rights.” HFFH’s vice-president is Tommy John, a chiropractor who claims the coronavirus does not exist, a line he held to even after his father, a retired baseball star also called Tommy, was hospitalised with Covid. As well as promoting HFFH via his Instagram account, John also links to a site selling T-shirts with slogans such as: “It’s not a pandemic. It’s worse.” One of HFFH’s board members is Joseph Yi MD, a “holistic psychiatrist” who runs a CBD oil business and is one of four doctors behind a supplement seller called Beyond Recovery. There are has links to both businesses on his Instagram page, where he has described the coronavirus pandemic as a “plandemic” and the “shiRONA charade”. Yi has said he believes masks aren’t effective and that tests for Covid-19 are “a scam”. HFFH did not respond to requests for comment. One of the most common ways of making money on Instagram is via affiliate programmes, which provide a cut of sales in return for product referrals. More than a dozen of the accounts investigated promoted heavy metal detox sprays. Many anti-vaccine groups and influencers claim, falsely, that trace amounts of heavy metals such as aluminium used in some vaccines cause health problems. Other accounts promote supplements and devices that promise to improve wellbeing, while misleading those same people about the public health emergency taking place around them. Although neither Instagram nor Facebook profits directly from these money-making schemes, their business model relies on keeping audiences engaged. Facebook, Instagram and other social media companies, such as YouTube, have regularly been criticised for increasing engagement by drawing users towards extremist or conspiracist content and views. Lord Puttnam, who heads the Lords committee on democracy and digital technology, accused Facebook and others of doing the absolute minimum to counter this. “What you are getting from them is Elastoplast and bandages because the problem is the fundamental business model,” he said. “The problem isn’t what they can put right. It’s that actually to put it right they have to alter their business model. If they alter their business model, they will be less profitable.” Nina Jankowicz, a disinformation researcher at US thinktank the Wilson Center, said Facebook could not absolve itself from responsibility for monetisation and misinformation even if it’s not done directly through Instagram. “They are providing the means by which this is amplified,” she said. “Instagram will say, ‘Well, this is a linktr.ee moderation platform,’ but they provide the tool through which people are amplifying these links.” Facebook said: “We take aggressive steps to remove Covid-19 misinformation, including false information about approved vaccines.” After the Bureau contacted Facebook, a number of accounts were taken down, including those belonging to Health Freedom for Humanity and Zeck. Linktr.ee has suspended accounts identified by the investigation. The company’s cofounder, Alex, said: “We’re committed to … enhancing our systems and processes so we can identify and catch misinformation before it reaches a large audience. We have never been in the business of, nor has it ever been our intention to, profit from the spread of information deliberately intended to deceive or cause harm.”","Covid conspiracy theorists are seeking to profit from the millions of followers they have built up on Instagram during the pandemic by marketing health supplements, wellness courses and juicers to them.

17,17,"Amazon’s fourth-generation Echo Dot has evolved from its predecessors’ puck-like appearance into a small ball, shaking up the idea of what a small smart speaker can look like. The new Echo Dot is priced the same as the last one, costing from £50, although it will be frequently available at a discount at various retailers, and looks like the full-sized £80 Echo hit with a shrink ray. It has a fabric top and front, hard plastic sides and back, and Amazon’s traditional four-button array for turning the volume up and down, muting the microphones and an action button. It is a cute little ball that doesn’t look like a speaker or its competition. But while it takes up the same footprint as its puck-shaped predecessor, it is about twice its height which makes it slightly less discreet in your home. The power cable plugs in the back next to a 3.5mm analogue audio socket for connecting external speakers but the Echo Dot has Bluetooth too. The light ring lights up at the bottom making it look like the speaker is glowing when Alexa is active or to show alerts or when adjusting the volume. Specifications Dimensions: 100 x 100 x 89mm Weight: 338g Connectivity: wifi 5 (ac), Bluetooth, 3.5mm analogue audio Controls: voice, top-mounted volume, action and mic mute Speakers: single 1.6in speaker Small ball of sound The Dot is larger and produces slightly fuller and wider audio because of it, despite having the same sized speaker as the third-generation model. It sounds surprisingly good for its size and price. The Dot lacks real bass, but it is otherwise pleasant to listen to music, the radio and Alexa’s voice with enough volume to fill a small room. Two can be paired for stereo sound and the Dot can be grouped with other Alexa-enabled speakers for multi-room audio. Alexa natively supports music streaming services from Spotify, Apple, Deezer or Amazon, or you can stream tunes to it via Bluetooth. Radio services are handled by TuneIn, or using BBC Sounds and other individual station “skills” you can install like apps using the Alexa app on your phone. Just like any other Alexa speaker it will read the news headlines, tell you the weather, answer questions, set alarms, timers and control smart home devices, too. Clock or not? The Dot comes in two versions: a regular Echo Dot and an Echo Dot with Clock for £10 more, which as the name suggests has an LED time display hidden behind the mesh at the front. They are functionally identical apart from the display, which shows the time, the outside temperature when asked, timers, the volume when adjusting it and the time of the alarm when setting it. A little white dot next to the time shows when an alarm has been set or a timer is active. As with its predecessor, the clock turns the Dot into a good bedside accessory. The brightness of the display automatically adjusts based on ambient light, but you can customise how bright that adjustment is. On its most dim setting it is slightly brighter than the outgoing model and produced enough light to create shadows on the wall at night. You can turn the display on and off with the Alexa app or via voice. Sustainability The speaker is generally repairable. It contains 100% post-consumer recycled fabric, 100% recycled die-cast aluminium and 50% post-consumer recycled plastic. Amazon has also pledged to offset the electricity used by Echo devices with renewable energy. Amazon also offers trade-in and recycling schemes. Observations You can tap the top to snooze an alarm, but I wish you could do it to just dismiss it too. You can change the wakeword from Alexa to Amazon, Echo or computer, but you still can’t change the gender of its voice, unlike competitors. Price The fourth-generation Amazon Echo Dot costs £49.99 or £59.99 with the LED clock. For comparison, the third-gen Echo Dot has been reduced to £39.99, the standard Echo costs £79.99, Google’s Nest Mini costs £49 and Apple’s HomePod mini costs £99. Verdict The fourth-generation Echo Dot is a cute, ball-like redesign that breaks the mould of the traditional puck or pincushion-like speakers. Bought with or without an LED display, the Dot continues to sound better than you’d expect – ideal for small rooms or background listening – and provide all of Alexa’s features in a good-value package costing £50 or less in Amazon’s frequent sales. It may look more interesting, but it is slightly harder to place at home than the previous lower-profile design. The Dot with Clock’s screen is a little brighter at its dimmest setting, which some may find irritating. Pros: Good value, Alexa, loud enough for small rooms, Bluetooth, 3.5mm socket, can be paired, frequently discounted, good mics, can be bought with or without LED clock, fresh design. Cons: no real bass, less discreet shape, clock display brighter than predecessor, potential privacy implications of having mics.

18,18,"The second-generation Apple TV 4K gets a faster processor and future-proofed specs, but is really all about its new iPod-inspired Siri remote. And it all comes at a price. Costing £169, the Apple media-streaming box is very much at the top of the market despite being £10 cheaper than its predecessor, with direct competitors priced between £50 and £130. But the Apple TV 4K offers something most others cannot: full integration with all of the iPhone-maker’s services including Siri, iTunes, TV+, Music, Fitness+ and the AirPlay 2 streaming system. The new model looks identical to the previous generation: a nondescript black box with a matt top, glossy sides and has a small LED on the front to show you that it’s on. Redesigned Siri remote The remote has been completely overhauled, introducing more traditional navigation buttons and a new touch-sensitive ring for scrolling reminiscent of the “click wheel” on the old iPods. It is a significant improvement over the old model. The new “clickpad” at the top of the remote comprises a pad with up, down, left, right and a centre button for select. The whole thing is touch sensitive so you can also swipe across it to navigate the interface and scrub through video. In apps that support it, users can press the pause button and then hold their finger on the outside ring for 0.5 seconds before moving it clockwise or anti-clockwise to scrub forward or backwards through videos, in a similar way to using old iPods. Note Disney+, YouTube, BritBox and a few others do not yet support the new gesture. tvOS 14.5 Apple’s ace-in-the-hole is comprehensive app developer support that outstretches competitors from Amazon, Google and Roku. Essentially every streaming service is available on it, including big brands such as Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video and YouTube (with Google Play Movies), plus all the usual UK TV services such as BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All 4, My5, STV Player, UK TV Play, Now, BT Sport, BritBox, Acorn and others. If you want one box for all the apps, the Apple TV is it. Then there are Apple’s iTunes, TV+, Arcade, Music, Fitness+ and Photos services, games and various utilities. It supports AirPlay 2, which allows you to send music and video from an iPhone or other Apple devices to the TV, but it does not support Google Cast. Specifications Processor: A12 Bionic RAM: 3GB Storage: 32 or 64GB Connectivity: wifi 6, gigabit ethernet, Bluetooth 5, HDMI 2.1 Software: tvOS 14.5 Format support: up to 4K@60Hz, HLG, Dolby Vision, HDR10 (high frame rate); Dolby Atmos, Digital and Digital Plus Dimensions: 35 x 98 x 98mm Weight: 425g A12 Bionic chip from the iPhone XS The new box uses the latest HDMI 2.1 specification to connect to the television, which is required for larger resolutions, higher frame rates and the eARC audio connection that are increasingly common on new TVs and soundbars. But it is also compatible with TVs that use older HDMI connections. It also has the newer wifi 6 standard, which should help those with poor overage get faster speeds to the Apple TV once they get a new router with wifi 6. Sustainability The Apple TV 4K uses 100% recycled tin in the solder of its logic board, 100% recycled aluminium in the remote and 20% recycled plastic in multiple components. Apple is also using renewable energy for final assembly, and breaks down the streaming box’s environmental impact in its report. The box is generally repairable costing £146.44 out of warranty. Repair specialists iFixit gave the Apple TV 4K a repairability score of eight out of 10, but noted that replacing the battery in the remote was difficult. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Observations It has a built-in Thread radio for connecting directly to compatible smart home devices. A clever feature calibrates the colour of your TV using the sensors on an iPhone to make the colour output more accurate, but isn’t needed if your television supports Dolby Vision. Apps that support high frame rate HDR (60 frames a second in 4K HDR) are very limited at launch. You can use an iPhone or iPad as a remote or to enter text, including pasting codes from password managers. Two pairs of Apple’s AirPods or Beats headphones can connect to the Apple TV for late-night movies without disturbing the neighbours, which is a killer feature. The box can output audio to AirPlay-compatible speakers instead of your TV, including the firm’s HomePod and HomePod mini. You can connect most Bluetooth joypads including Xbox and PlayStation controllers to play games. Price The second-generation Apple TV 4K costs £169 with 32GB of storage or £189 with 64GB. The new Siri remote can be bought separately for £55. For comparison, the Apple TV HD costs £139, the Nvidia Shield TV costs £129, the Google Chromecast with Google TV costs £59.99, the Roku Streaming Stick+ costs £49.99 and the Amazon Fire TV Cube costs £109.99. Verdict The new Apple TV 4K is essentially the same as the old one, with all its qualities and capabilities, but with future-proofed specs and a really great, iPod-like remote. That means you get a highly capable streaming media box with wider app support than competitors and full integration with Apple’s various devices and services, including killer features like being able to use two sets of AirPods for late-night listening. But it is very expensive compared with competitors, costing less than half as much, and lacks Google Cast, so is less useful for Android users. It is not worth upgrading from the previous model, but for those looking to replace older kit or just for the best smart streaming box available for iPhone users, the second-generation Apple TV 4K is it. Pros: widest streaming app support, good remote, Dolby Vision/Atmos, HDR10, HDMI 2.1, wifi 6, AirPlay 2, full iPhone/Apple services integration, Siri/voice control, connect two pairs of AirPods at the same time for private listening. Cons: very expensive, no Google Cast, not as easy to use with Android, new remote features don’t work with every app. Other reviews HomePod mini review: Apple’s smaller and cheaper smart speaker Chromecast with Google TV review: full smart TV upgrade with voice remote Nvidia Shield TV review: the best Android TV box with brilliant AI upscaling Amazon Fire TV Cube review: great smart TV box, irritating smart speaker Sky Q 2019 review: premium TV at a premium price Virgin V6 TV review: jack of all trades, master of none Best UK streaming and pay-TV services 2020: Sky, Virgin, Netflix and Amazon Prime compared and ranked","Specifications Processor: A12 Bionic RAM: 3GB Storage: 32 or 64GB Connectivity: wifi 6, gigabit ethernet, Bluetooth 5, HDMI 2.1 Software: tvOS 14.5 Format support: up to 4K@60Hz, HLG, Dolby Vision, HDR10 (high frame rate); Dolby Atmos, Digital and Digital Plus Dimensions: 35 x 98 x 98mm Weight: 425g A12 Bionic chip from the iPhone XS The new box uses the latest HDMI 2.1 specification to connect to the television, which is required for larger resolutions, higher frame rates and the eARC audio connection that are increasingly common on new TVs and soundbars.

19,19,"The US justice department has recovered the majority of a multimillion-dollar ransom payment to hackers after a cyber-attack that caused the operator of the nation’s largest fuel pipeline to halt its operations last month, officials said on Monday. The operation to recover the cryptocurrency from the Russia-based hacker group is the first undertaken by a specialized ransomware taskforce created by the Biden administration, and reflects what US officials say is an increasingly aggressive approach to deal with a ransomware threat that in the last month has targeted critical industries around the world. “By going after an entire ecosystem that fuels ransomware and digital currency, we will continue to use all of our tools and all of our resources to increase the costs and the consequences of ransomware attacks and other cyber-enabled attacks,” deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco said on Monday at a news conference announcing the operation. Georgia-based Colonial Pipeline, which supplies roughly half the fuel consumed on the US east coast, temporarily shut down its operations on 7 May after a gang of criminal hackers known as DarkSide broke into its computer system. Colonial officials have said they took their pipeline system offline before the attack could spread to its operating system, and decided to pay a roughly $4.4m ransom in hopes of bringing computers back online as soon as it could. The 63.7 bitcoin ransom – a favored currency of hackers because of the perception that it is more difficult to trace – is currently valued at $2.3m. “The extortionists will never see this money,” said Stephanie Hinds, the acting US attorney for the northern district of California, where the seizure warrant was filed. The FBI generally discourages the payment of ransom, fearing it could encourage additional hacks, a stance reiterated by the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, last Friday during the daily media briefing. On that day, the FBI director, Christopher Wray, warned that tackling cyber hacks and ransomware attacks on US government and commercial entities would be akin to battling the international terrorist threat to the US following the hijacking attacks masterminded by al-Qaida on 9/11. Joe Biden plans to bring the issue up with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in the two leaders’ scheduled meeting in Switzerland later this month, with the Biden administration emphasizing that even if the Russian government is not behind these attacks, countries harboring cybercrime gangs must be responsible for dealing with them. Monaco said the takeaway for the private sector is that if companies come quickly to law enforcement, officials may be able to conduct similar seizures in the future. Soon after the cyber-attack on Colonial Pipeline, another attack took meat-processing factories across the US offline. Attacks generally consist of a group of cybercriminals hacking into a company, or, for example, a local or state government’s, network, and scramble the data. The hacker then demands payment in exchange for handing back control of the system. In the Colonial Pipeline case, Darkside took responsibility for the attack. “DarkSide is a ransomware-as-a-service network – that means developers who sell or lease ransomware to use in attacks, in return for a fee or share in the proceeds,” said Monaco. “DarkSide and its affiliates have digitally stalked US companies for the better part of the year, and indiscriminately attacked victims that include key players in our nation’s critical infrastructure. Today, we turned the tables on DarkSide. Asked at the press conference on Monday if the latest developments mean other companies should also pay ransoms, Monaco said no. “We cannot guarantee – and we may not be able to do this in every instance.”","The US justice department has recovered the majority of a multimillion-dollar ransom payment to hackers after a cyber-attack that caused the operator of the nation’s largest fuel pipeline to halt its operations last month, officials said on Monday.

20,20,"One of the world’s biggest web outages should act as a “wake-up call” that internet infrastructure has become dangerously over-centralised and lacks resilience, security experts have warned. An unexplained configuration error at a single infrastructure provider, Fastly, which handles 10% of the world’s internet traffic, was enough to render major websites and services inoperable for almost an hour on Tuesday morning. Online businesses including Reddit, Amazon, Twitch, Spotify and Hulu were knocked offline, as was the Guardian’s website, the BBC, the New York Times, and CNN. National governments were also caught up: gov.uk was unavailable, making a host of government services inaccessible include the Covid vaccines booking site, as was the website for the White House. The affected sites all used Fastly as a content delivery network (CDN), a service intended to provide greater reliability and performance for heavily trafficked websites. A CDN is a global network of servers, placed so that at least one server is close enough for a fast connection wherever a user lives. Customers like the Guardian send visitors to the CDN rather than their own servers, providing the content faster and protecting the website from being overloaded in the event of a spike in traffic. But a CDN can also serve as a single point of failure: if the network collapses, it can also block all traffic going to the websites it protects. CDNs are more efficient the larger they are, creating a concentration of power to the market. The vast majority of internet traffic is routed through a handful of CDNs, such as Fastly, Cloudflare, Akamai or Amazon’s CloudFront. David Warburton, of the cybersecurity company F5 Labs, said centralisation is relatively new in the history of the internet and is likely to continue to cause problems. “The web as a whole was intended to be decentralised,” he said. “By not relying on any one central system, it meant that many different components could fail and internet traffic could still find a way to get where it needed to go. What we’ve seen over the past decade, however, is the unintentional centralisation of many core services through large cloud solution providers like infrastructure vendors and CDNs.” Paddy McGuinness, who was deputy national security adviser responsible for intelligence security and resilience between 2014 and 2018, said the outage should be considered “a wake-up call” and politicians needed to broaden the existing security-driven approach as technology brings new services to the British public. “We need resilience as an explicit policy goal, especially on the new networks we are building to deliver services to the citizen,” said the former Whitehall insider, who worked under two prime ministers, David Cameron and Theresa May. “A ‘secure by design and default’ mantra is welcome but it isn’t enough in itself.” The intelligence agencies GCHQ and its cybersecurity arm the NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre) working alone “could not prevent disruption”, McGuinness argued, partly because a key part of their remit was to detect and prevent hostile state and hacker attacks, rather than ensuring the long-term stability of critical consumer services. The cost of such an outage can be enormous. In 2015, when the scale of the internet economy was a fraction of today’s, the cost of cloud service outages were estimated at almost $300m (about £210m) a year, says Prof Rebecca Parry, of Nottingham Law School. “Liability for loss of service will probably be covered by the ‘service level agreement’ with customers of paid-for cloud services,” Parry said, “but the agreements will typically not cover all losses sustained.” A typical Fastly customer is unlikely to receive more than $1,000 in refunded fees for the outage, those with knowledge of the company’s “service level agreements” say. But their true costs could be hundreds of times that, says Chris Huggett, of Sungard Availability Services. “With the average cost of downtime now $250,000 an hour, every minute counts.” In November 2020, AWS, Amazon’s cloud-hosting arm, suffered a multi-hour outage in the middle of the US west coast’s afternoon. The collapse in the service, which interacts with about 40% of the entire internet, took out sites and services including 1Password, Flickr, iRobot, and the Washington Post. Months earlier, a failure at Cloudflare, another CDN like Fastly, had rendered much of the web inoperable. That was traced to a single error in a physical link between datacentres in Newark and Chicago, which spiralled into an outage that took almost two hours to fix fully. Warburton said following the Fastly outage on Tuesday: “In a traditional internet app deployment model, an outage of a server or misconfigured application might take out a single website. As we saw today, similar problems with a cloud solution provider can end up taking out all of their customers, resulting in not one website being taken offline, but hundreds or thousands. The impact can affect organisations’ digital experiences, revenues and reputations. “The ‘re-centralisation’ of the internet through these cloud solutions is now causing the very problems the original design of the internet was intended to avoid through redundancy. It’s important we consider an approach that moves us away from single points of failure or we will likely see more issues like we did today.” • This article was amended on 9 and 10 June 2021 to clarify that Chris Huggett was speaking about the costs of the Fastly outage, not the likely refunds as suggested in an earlier version. Also, Akamai was added as one of the main CDNs, and an incorrect reference to the outage being an “attack” was changed.","Customers like the Guardian send visitors to the CDN rather than their own servers, providing the content faster and protecting the website from being overloaded in the event of a spike in traffic.

21,21,"The prospect of a deepening diplomatic row between the US and China has grown after a Canadian judge refused to admit new evidence that might have helped the Huawei chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, avoid extradition to the US. The arrest of Meng, the daughter of the Chinese telecommunication company’s billionaire founder, has prompted a sharp deterioration in relations between Canada, the US and China. Soon after Meng’s detention in Vancouver in December 2018, China arrested two Canadians in China: Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig. Meng’s lawyers had been hoping associate chief justice Heather Holmes, who has been overseeing the case in the British Columbia supreme court, would allow her to use at least some of the documents obtained from HSBC through a Hong Kong court hearing. The lawyers believe the papers show she did not mislead HSBC senior executives over Huawei’s links to an Iranian firm. She is facing fraud charges in the US over allegedly misleading HSBC, and Huawei largely regards the case as part of a trade war instigated by Donald Trump. Holmes will give her reasons at a later stage, but her ruling shows the extent to which Canadian law is reluctant to let the extradition hearing, due to start next month, turn into a substantive trial of whether she has misled HSBC. Meng’s lawyers had gone to great lengths to obtain the internal bank documents, first suing unsuccessfully in the British court before winning in Hong Kong, followed by a ruling in a Canadian court that the documents including email chains should be published. Huawei Canada said it respected the court’s decision but regretted the outcome. It said: “The documents demonstrate clearly that HSBC, including its senior executives, were aware of Huawei’s relationship with Skycom and its business in Iran. They show that America’s Record of Case is manifestly unreliable. The hearings continue and as always we continue to support Ms Meng in her pursuit of justice and freedom.” Lawyers for Meng claim the documents prove the US misled the Canadians in its summary to Canada of the case against her. In particular the US government misled the Canadian authorities in requesting her arrest in Vancouver about the extent of HSBC’s knowledge of the transactions between Huawei and a subsidiary, Skycom, and the relationship between the two firms. The US claims Meng gave an HSBC executive a PowerPoint presentation at a meeting in Hong Kong which left the impression that Skycom was just a local Huawei business partner, not a subsidiary. Prosecutors claim HSBC relied on Meng’s word in deciding to continue handling Huawei’s financial transactions, putting the bank at risk of a reputation loss and prosecution for violating the same sanctions. The prosecutors in court have admitted the documents show HSBC executives were provided sufficient information to make them understand the true relationship, but no evidence that the executives actually reached that understanding. There has been speculation that the US administration might want the case to be dropped, but once the wheels of justice have been set in train, it is very hard for anyone to bring them to a halt. Meng’s original extradition hearing had been scheduled for last April but the judge granted her lawyers more time to review the documents from the Hong Kong court. The extradition case is now due to begin on 3 August and could last through the autumn. Meng remains out on bail, living in Vancouver on a curfew with her husband and children.","The prospect of a deepening diplomatic row between the US and China has grown after a Canadian judge refused to admit new evidence that might have helped the Huawei chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, avoid extradition to the US.

22,22,"Fast-growing firms working on “gamechanging” technology, including in areas such as life sciences and clean energy, are being invited to apply for a slice of a £375m fund aimed at fostering innovation in the UK. The future fund: breakthrough scheme will involve the government committing to co-invest alongside private enterprise to give extra impetus to businesses looking for cash to take nascent technologies to the next step. In an effort to make the UK a “science superpower”, the Treasury will favour industries such as quantum computing, life sciences and clean technology, in an effort to spur breakthroughs that can “solve some of society’s greatest challenges”. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said: “Technology and innovation will be at the heart of our future economy which is why we are investing billions in R&amp;D [research and development] to help cement our status as a world leader in this field. “Above all, our investment will incentivise collaboration between our most ambitious entrepreneurs and private investors, helping to commercialise breakthrough products such as new medicines and green technologies that could change our lives for the better – all while creating high-skilled jobs that help boost the UK economy.” To qualify, firms will have to be UK-based and seeking at least £30m to fund further development. Private companies will have to make up the bulk of the investment, with applicants required to show that they have already secured commitments for 70% of their funding round. Applicants must show that they have previously been able to raise £5m without state help, indicating that they are already growing significantly. The companies will not apply themselves, with their lead investor instead making the connection between the business and the future fund. Sunak will host a tech conference in east London in September, under the banner Treasury Connect, to bring together investors and business leaders in tech. The Treasury said government funding was needed alongside private capital because breakthrough technology often requires patience, demanding more money over long time periods in order to make progress. The department said it had already provided more than £1bn of convertible loans to 1,190 businesses to help them through the pandemic, via the future fund. Government spending on R&amp;D is slated to hit £14.9bn for 2021 and 2022, the highest level in four decades, as part of an effort to increase investment in innovation to 2.4% of economic output by 2027. The new future fund was announced at Sunak’s budget earlier this year and will be administered by the British Business Bank’s subsidiary, British Patient Capital. Judith Hartley, chief executive of British Patient Capital, said: “With many world-class universities and a strong track record in science and research, the UK is fertile ground for creating high-growth companies based on cutting edge technologies. “Through the commercialisation of R&amp;D, these transformative companies will help accelerate the deployment of innovative breakthrough technologies that can transform major industries, develop new medicines, support the transition to a net zero economy and strengthen the UK’s position as a science superpower.”","The future fund: breakthrough scheme will involve the government committing to co-invest alongside private enterprise to give extra impetus to businesses looking for cash to take nascent technologies to the next step.

23,23,"Facebook could be forced to sell gif creation website Giphy after an investigation by the UK competition regulator found its takeover could harm competition among social media companies and the digital advertising market. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched an in-depth investigation earlier this year into Facebook’s acquisition of Giphy, the largest supplier of animated gifs to social networks such as Snapchat, TikTok and Twitter, after identifying a number of concerns about the $400m (£290m) deal which was struck last year. Gifs are embeddable clips, usually no more than a few seconds long. The most popular gif of 2020 was Thank You by Red &amp; Howling, which shows a cartoon dog expressing its thanks to pandemic essential workers, which Giphy says was viewed more than a billion times. The CMA said in its provisional findings that “our initial view [is] that the only effective way to address the competition issues that we have identified is for Facebook to sell Giphy, in its entirety, to a suitable buyer”. The watchdog found that Facebook’s ownership of Giphy, which it aims to integrate with its Instagram social media site, could lead to it stopping supplying gifs to other social media sites. Or Facebook could demand more user data from Giphy’s social media customers to continue to get access to its gifs, increasing the company’s already “significant” market power. “Millions of people share gifs every day with friends, family and colleagues, and this number continues to grow,” said Stuart McIntosh, chair of the independent inquiry group investigating the deal. “Giphy’s takeover could see Facebook withdrawing gifs from competing platforms or requiring more user data in order to access them.” The watchdog said the deal also removes a potential competitor from the £5.5bn UK digital display advertising market, where Facebook is the biggest player accounting for more than half the market. The CMA said Giphy had offered paid advertising in the US with customers including Pepsi and had been considering expanding the service to countries including the UK, but Facebook terminated all deals after the takeover. Facebook has said in submissions to the investigation that Giphy, which has no revenues or staff in the UK, did not compete with it before the merger and Instagram was committed to continuing to allow rivals access to the library of images. “We disagree with the CMA’s preliminary findings, which we do not believe to be supported by the evidence,” said a Facebook spokesperson. “As we have demonstrated, this merger is in the best interest of people and businesses in the UK – and around the world – who use Giphy and our services. We will continue to work with the CMA to address the misconception that the deal harms competition.” Although Facebook and Giphy are headquartered in the US, the CMA has the power to investigate mergers where the business being acquired has annual revenues of at least £70m or when the combined businesses have at least a 25% share of any “reasonable” market. The Facebook-Giphy deal is also being investigated by competition regulators in countries including Australia and Austria. “While our investigation has shown serious completion concerns, these are provisional,” McIntosh said. “We will now consult on our findings before completing our review. Should we conclude that the merger is detrimental to the market and social media users, we will take the necessary actions to make sure people are protected.” The CMA has the power to force Facebook to sell Giphy, either through undertakings or via an order, which can be legally enforced through court action. The regulator is now seeking responses to its provisional findings and will issue its final report by 6 October. The watchdog is in the process of setting up a new dedicated digital markets unit, which will police a new enforceable code of conduct to stop tech giants such as Google and Facebook abusing their power when dealing with third parties.","“Giphy’s takeover could see Facebook withdrawing gifs from competing platforms or requiring more user data in order to access them.” The watchdog said the deal also removes a potential competitor from the £5.5bn UK digital display advertising market, where Facebook is the biggest player accounting for more than half the market.

24,24,"Facebook has announced plans to become “water positive” by 2030, restoring more water than the company consumes globally. The firm is leaning further into a virtuous skirmish between the world’s largest technology players, as they all compete to be the first to achieve carbon neutrality, commit to offsetting the emissions created by their customers as well as their own operations, and even plan to eliminate all carbon emitted over the organisation’s lifetime. “Facebook has always strived to responsibly manage how we use water resources in the communities we operate in,” said Sylvia Lee, Facebook’s sustainability water lead. “We follow a water stewardship strategy that focuses on sourcing water responsibly, driving water efficiency across our facilities and operations, as well as investing in critical water restoration projects in the same watersheds where our facilities are located. Now we’re going even further and pledging to be water positive by 2030, meaning we will restore more water than we consume [evaporate].” Like many technology companies, Facebook’s water use is substantial, primarily due to its role in cooling datacentres. Just one Facebook datacentre in Albuquerque in the US, for instance, has access to more than 0.5bn litres of water rights a year, which has caused conflict with local farms and businesses which worry that an expansion could harm their own ability to operate. Facebook said it had already started work to reduce that load by developing new technologies for cooling and humidifying datacentres. These have increased their water efficiency by 80% “compared to the industry standard”. But the new push for water positivity will involve the company also working on water restoration projects in water-stressed areas. The organisation said it had already invested in projects that replenish more than 850m gallons of water a year across six American states, including New Mexico, California and Utah. It plans to extend the work to cover Ireland, Singapore, India, the UK and Mexico in the future. “Facebook’s water goal represents the leading practice for operational water targets,” said the World Resources Institute. “More companies and industries need to follow this example and set forward-looking targets to be resilient in an increasingly uncertain future.” It comes after Facebook announced that it had successfully achieved net zero emissions in April, paving the way for it to meet a further goal of net zero emissions across its entire supply chain by 2030. That sort of ambitious target is fast becoming the norm in the sector. Apple committed to a goal of carbon neutrality for itself, its suppliers, and even the electricity used to power its products in users’ homes by 2030, while last year Microsoft pledged that it would have removed all carbon it has ever emitted by 2050.","The firm is leaning further into a virtuous skirmish between the world’s largest technology players, as they all compete to be the first to achieve carbon neutrality, commit to offsetting the emissions created by their customers as well as their own operations, and even plan to eliminate all carbon emitted over the organisation’s lifetime. “We follow a water stewardship strategy that focuses on sourcing water responsibly, driving water efficiency across our facilities and operations, as well as investing in critical water restoration projects in the same watersheds where our facilities are located.

25,25,"Apple has told its global workforce they will not return to its corporate offices until January at the earliest, over concerns about a rise in Covid-19 cases driven by the spread of the Delta variant. The iPhone maker, which will still keep its network of retail stores open, had previously told staff there would be a phased return to work from October. The delayed office return applies to its international workforce, including those based in the UK. The company told staff in a memo that it would confirm the reopening plans one month before employees were required to return to the office, according to Bloomberg News. The memo, sent by the human resources and retail head, Deirdre O’Brien, added that the company did not currently expect to close its offices or retail stores, but she strongly encouraged staff to get vaccinated. “I know there are feelings of frustration that the pandemic is not yet behind us,” she wrote. “For many colleagues around the world this period has been a time of great tragedy, suffering and heartbreak. Please know that we are all here to support one another and stand with one another during such challenging times.” Apple, which last month reinstated the mask-wearing policy for in-store staff that it had only decided to scrap in June, had previously planned to ask staff to return to its offices on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays by early September, before delaying that to October. Employees would be able to work remotely on Wednesdays and Fridays. In the UK, the company employs 7,000 staff and operates 38 retail stores, the most in any country in Europe. Apple’s main UK corporate offices are based in Regent Street, central London, and Stockley Park, near Heathrow. It is in the process of building new offices on a 17-hectare (42 acres) site at Battersea power station, which will be home to 4,000 staff and was meant to open this year. Apple’s European headquarters are in Cork, Ireland. The tech giant’s announcement comes as the US faces a new surge in coronavirus infections driven by the Delta variant, with new case numbers averaging more than 130,000 a day after months of decline. Apple is the latest major corporation to decide conditions are not yet safe enough to expect staff to return to offices. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it would push back the reopening of its corporate offices from September until at least 4 October. Amazon staff will remain working remotely until at least 3 January, while Google has extended its voluntary work from home period until 18 October, having previously outlined plans for a September return. Last month the ride-hailing service Uber pushed its office return back to October, while its rival Lyft does not expect office staff to return until February 2022.

26,26,"Twitter is trialling an anti-troll feature that will automatically block accounts sending abuse to users. Once Twitter’s new “safety mode” is activated by a user, it will temporarily block accounts for seven days if the tech firm’s systems spot them using harmful language or sending repetitive, uninvited replies and mentions. It comes as social media firms face continued pressure to protect users from online abuse, such as the targeting of black England footballers after the Euro 2020 final. “We want you to enjoy healthy conversations, so this test is one way we’re limiting overwhelming and unwelcome interactions that can interrupt those conversations,” said Jarrod Doherty, a senior product manager at Twitter. “Our goal is to better protect the individual on the receiving end of tweets by reducing the prevalence and visibility of harmful remarks.” The feature will be trialled initially among a small group of users, described as a “feedback group”, with a particular emphasis on female journalists and members of marginalised communities. The safety mode will be available on iOS, Android and desktop and can be turned on via the Twitter settings. It will not block accounts that users follow or interact with frequently. Accounts that are autoblocked will not be able to follow your account, see your tweets or send direct messages for one week. However, users will be able to view the details of blocked accounts at any time in order to rapidly undo any misinterpretations by Twitter’s systems. “We won’t always get this right and may make mistakes, so safety mode autoblocks can be seen and undone at any time in your settings. We’ll also regularly monitor the accuracy of our safety mode systems to make improvements to our detection capabilities,” said Doherty. Twitter said it had consulted experts in online safety, mental health and human rights as it developed the anti-abuse feature, with those same people helping nominate members of the feedback group. Article 19, a UK-based digital rights group that took part in the talks, called the feature “another step in the right direction”. Doherty said the feature would undergo changes before being introduced to the site’s more than 200 million active users: “We’ll observe how safety mode is working and incorporate improvements and adjustments before bringing it to everyone on Twitter.” Twitter permanently suspended 56 users the day after the Euro 2020 final in July after a public and political outcry over abusive tweets directed at Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka. However, the Guardian learned last month that that 30 of the suspended users had since reposted on the network, often under slightly altered usernames. A Guardian study of Twitter messages directed at and naming the England team during the three group stage matches also identified more than 2,000 abusive messages, including scores of racist posts. Twitter has already rolled out a new prompt to users who are about to send a tweet that its algorithms believe could be “harmful or offensive”. Those who try to send such a message will be asked if they “want to review this before tweeting”, with the options to edit, delete, or send anyway. In May the company said trials had shown the feature had helped reduce the posting of abuse.","“Our goal is to better protect the individual on the receiving end of tweets by reducing the prevalence and visibility of harmful remarks.” The feature will be trialled initially among a small group of users, described as a “feedback group”, with a particular emphasis on female journalists and members of marginalised communities.

","“Our goal is to better protect the individual on the receiving end of tweets by reducing the prevalence and visibility of harmful remarks.” The feature will be trialled initially among a small group of users, described as a “feedback group”, with a particular emphasis on female journalists and members of marginalised communities. Article 19, a UK-based digital rights group that took part in the talks, called the feature “another step in the right direction”. However, the Guardian learned last month that that 30 of the suspended users had since reposted on the network, often under slightly altered usernames. Those who try to send such a message will be asked if they “want to review this before tweeting”, with the options to edit, delete, or send anyway.

27,27,"Name: Free Blockbuster. Age: Founded in 2018. Appearance: Post-apocalyptic entertainment network. But what is Blockbuster, and why does it need freeing? Blockbuster was an international chain of video rental outlets, which filed for bankruptcy in 2010. Sorry, an international chain of what? Video rental outlets – shops where you could hire films to play in your VCR. I think you had better start at the beginning. Once upon a time, when you wanted to watch a movie at home, you had to go out and acquire it in the form of a VHS tape. You mean those fat square DVDs you sometimes find in the attics of houses scheduled for demolition? That’s them. One of two rival formats – the other was Betamax – VHS eventually claimed victory after a long and difficult battle for the hearts of consumers. I’ve heard about this. Is that what the civil war was about? Enough history – the point is that the VHS tape is back. The Free Blockbuster movement, founded by Brian Morrison, a Los Angeles resident, has transformed abandoned newspaper vending boxes into mini-libraries for those wanting to borrow and lend old tapes. And it has a following? There are 69 boxes across the US, Canada and Australia. Weird, but OK. Morrison is not alone. Andy Johnson, who runs what is claimed to be the UK’s last remaining video shop in Toxteth, Liverpool, has recently rescued a collection of 20,000 VHS tapes. Why are people suddenly so keen on VHS? Was the quality that good? No, it was terrible. Then let me be the first to say that I don’t get it. It’s something akin to the enduring fascination with vinyl, but it’s also nostalgia for classic films of the 80s and 90s, which a certain demographic first saw on VHS. Maybe the primitive technology is simpler for these geezers. Not any more – if you want to play a VHS tape on a modern smart TV, you need a special converter. So they’re just trying to recreate the magic of a bygone era. It did seem like a miracle at the time – you could watch Footloose as many times as you wanted! How many times was that? Not quite one, as it turned out. If it makes some old people happy, who can say a word against it? Blockbuster. The company was bought out of bankruptcy in 2011, still maintains one store in Oregon and doesn’t like its name being used on old newspaper boxes full of free videos. Do say: “Be kind, rewind.” Don’t say: “Ghost Thrusters – how did I miss this one?”","Once upon a time, when you wanted to watch a movie at home, you had to go out and acquire it in the form of a VHS tape.

28,28,"Antigone Davis, Facebook’s global head of safety, faced a grilling before the US Congress on Thursday in a hearing examining the impacts of the company’s products on children. Thursday’s hearing of the Senate commerce, science and transportation subcommittee comes after a series of Wall Street Journal reports based on internal Facebook leaks, including a story that revealed research showing the harmful effects of Instagram on childhood mental health. Senators took a hard line against the company, hammering into the research and highlighting Facebook’s attempts to obfuscate it leading up to the hearing. “Facebook knows the disruptive consequences that Instagram’s design and algorithms are having on young people in our society, but it has routinely prioritized its own rapid growth over basic safety for our children,” said Richard Blumenthal, the chair of the subcommittee, in his opening statement. “This research is a bombshell,” Blumenthal said. “It is powerful, gripping, riveting evidence that Facebook knows of the harmful effects of its site on children, and that it has concealed those facts and findings.” Blumenthal noted that his office conducted its own research into Instagram, posing as a 13-year-old girl and following accounts associated with eating disorders to see what Instagram would recommend. It found the platform sent the account further into the rabbit hole of harmful content. “Our research shows right now, in real time, Instagram’s recommendations latch on to a person’s insecurities, a young woman’s vulnerability, about their bodies and drag them into dark places that glorify eating disorders and self-harm,” said Blumenthal. “IG stands for Instagram, but it also stands for Insta-greed,” said Senator Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts. The research that sparked the hearing, revealed in the Wall Street Journal report, was commissioned by Instagram, which is a subsidiary of Facebook, and showed that the photo app could affect girls’ mental health on issues such as body image and self-esteem. Facebook’s head of research last week issued a rebuttal to the WSJ revelations, arguing that it was “simply not accurate” that the company’s research showed Instagram was toxic for teenage girls. But the company did pause a product it had been developing for users under the age of 13 called Instagram Kids. “While we stand by the need to develop this experience, we’ve decided to pause this project,” Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, wrote in a blogpost. Hours before the hearing, Facebook released two slide decks of research that it said formed the “primary focus” of the WSJ’s “mischaracterisation” of its work. The Journal responded by publishing the full scope of the slides, which painted a bleak picture of just how much Facebook knew about the negative impact of its products on teenage girls. Davis in the hearing declined to say how long Facebook would pause plans for Instagram Kids or and pushed back against arguments that it be scrapped completely. “We know young people under the age of 12 are already online on apps that aren’t designed for them,” she said. “We want to get their parents the supervisory tools and insights that they need to manage the amount of time that they’re spending.” Davis faced repeated questions on what data the company collects on young users and whether it views those users as a growth area. She reiterated that kids under 13 were not allowed on Facebook, and argued that the number of teens that, in the research, had connected “suicidal ideation” to Instagram was lower than the figures the Journal had reported. Several senators compared Facebook to big tobacco. Blumenthal stated Facebook “has taken big tobacco’s playbook”. “It has hidden its own research on addiction, and the toxic effects of its products,” he said. “It has attempted to deceive the public and us in Congress about what it knows, and it has weaponized childhood vulnerabilities against children themselves, it’s chosen growth over children’s mental health and greed over preventing the suffering of children.” Like big tobacco, the tech giant is “pushing a harmful product to the young”, argued Markey, adding that, “Instagram is that first childhood cigarette meant to get teens hooked early.” Senators also highlighted the need to update the 1998 Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, or Coppa – the federal law that protects children and their data online. “The safeguards in place are not enough,” said Maria Cantwell, chair of the commerce committee. Thursday’s hearing makes clear that the revelations about Instagram and mental health have had an impact on Facebook. Although Davis said that Instagram will continue its discussions with parents and policymakers about an Instagram product for kids, the hearing suggested that any fresh Facebook product aimed at the under-13 market will face a barrage of political opposition. Facebook can also expect more demands to release research data. “You’ve cherry-picked part of the research that you think helps your spin right now,” said Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, while demanding the company commit to releasing its full research on the links between Instagram and youth suicide. Davis refused to commit to releasing more internal Instagram research and any other research by Facebook, pointing at privacy issues as and the number of internal decision-makers within the company to be consulted. Thursday’s hearing marks the latest congressional inquiry in a tumultuous few years for Facebook, which has been forced to send executives to testify on the Hill a number of times about topics including misinformation and antitrust concerns. Next week, lawmakers are expected to hear from the whistleblower who provided the internal reports to the Journal. Children online safety advocates have called the pause on Instagram for Kids a victory, but are encouraging the company to scrap plans entirely. “Make no mistake that they are still going to try to build it,” said Jim Steyer, founder and CEO of non-profit children’s media watchdog Common Sense. “The only thing they care about is hooking kids when they are most vulnerable, keeping them on the platform and getting access to as much of their personal data as possible.” “This is their business model that generates billions of dollars and they are not going to jeopardize that,” he added. Reuters contributed to this report","The research that sparked the hearing, revealed in the Wall Street Journal report, was commissioned by Instagram, which is a subsidiary of Facebook, and showed that the photo app could affect girls’ mental health on issues such as body image and self-esteem. “We want to get their parents the supervisory tools and insights that they need to manage the amount of time that they’re spending.” Davis faced repeated questions on what data the company collects on young users and whether it views those users as a growth area.

29,29,"There are posters, stickers and coffee mugs, flags, T-shirts and masks – all celebrating Silicon Valley “girl boss”, Elizabeth Holmes. The fraud case of the Theranos founder has given way to a burgeoning cottage industry for merchandise venerating the disgraced CEO. As Holmes stands trial in a California courthouse, hundreds of listings have sprung up across online marketplaces including Etsy and Redbubble, catering to “Holmies” – the name used by some followers of the former executive. One shop called “We Are Elizabeth Holmes” has 26 products sporting original designs of the founder’s stenciled image. Some feature a favorite quote of Holmes: “First they think you’re crazy, then they fight you, then you change the world.” Some vendors and customers seem to earnestly support the former founder, but many are embracing the in-between. Many listings appear ironic. A common refrain – “gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss” – pokes fun at a wave of feminism that encouraged women to succeed within capitalism. “To be clear, we don’t condone any criminal activity, but we’re tickled that she was able to get so far on a lie, in an industry so heavily dominated by men,” a representative from one shop said. “She’s oozes femme fatale energy and who doesn’t like a good villain origin story?” Summer , the vendor behind Etsy shop TheTrendyVegan said she sells her Holmes T-shirts to “do a small part in opening up this conversation” around the complicated legacy of the founder. The TrendyVegan shirts say “they hate to see a girl boss winning” with a picture of Holmes and “money over everything”. Summer said she is hoping Holmes will be found not guilty in the trial, citing reports about Holmes’s planned defense that she was a victim of domestic violence and was swayed into her role as a defrauder by her ex-business partner and former lover Sonny Balwani. Balwani has strongly denied that accusation. “We need to learn to stop seeing people – and especially women – in only black or white,” she said. “In my opinion, Elizabeth isn’t a hero or a villain, but a complex and unique woman. She fought to get to achieve the levels of success she did, and she endured a lot of hardship along the way, including potential domestic abuse.” Lauren Kreiser, a comedian who purchased a Holmes shirt from Etsy, said her choice to wear the founder’s face is part tongue-in-cheek, but also a testament to the irresistible intrigue of the Theranos scam. “She herself is really fascinating; it is hard to tell what exactly is going on there and what her psychology is,” she said, adding that she has published an online sketch in which she plays Holmes, has seen the Theranos documentary, read the book Bad Blood, and is still listening to podcasts on the trial. Dozens of people have flocked to the San Jose courtroom where Holmes is standing trial for defrauding clients and investors. Multiple TV series and movies chronicling the company are in production. Three women outside the courthouse in the first days of the trial were speculated to be “cosplaying” Holmes, dressed similarly to the founder and identifying themselves as “fans”. Many people are fascinated with Holmes regardless of whether they believe she is guilty, said Edward Balleisen, a professor at Duke university who wrote the book Fraud: An American History from Barnum to Madoff. Those who believe Holmes meant to defraud people may see her as a hero for “sticking it to the man” and misleading rich investors, while others still think of her as a Silicon Valley success story. “It is not surprising, in a culture that celebrates people overcoming limitations to succeed that this story has been captivating for so many people – even if it wasn’t true,” Balleisen said. Laura Gallaher, organizational psychologist and expert in company culture and its impacts, said it was unsurprising Holmes’s cult following had outlasted the Theranos company itself. “Even though her device didn’t do what it said it would do, people are still holding on to this hero narrative because they wanted her to succeed,” she said. “People still want to believe.” Holmes’s defense team did not reply to a request for comment on the merchandise.","“She’s oozes femme fatale energy and who doesn’t like a good villain origin story?” Summer , the vendor behind Etsy shop TheTrendyVegan said she sells her Holmes T-shirts to “do a small part in opening up this conversation” around the complicated legacy of the founder.

30,30,"Facebook puts “astronomical profits before people”, harms children and is destabilising democracies, a whistleblower has claimed in testimony to the US Congress. Frances Haugen said Facebook knew it steered young users towards damaging content and that its Instagram app was “like cigarettes” for under-18s. In a wide-ranging testimony, the former Facebook employee said the company did not have enough staff to keep the platform safe and was “literally fanning” ethnic violence in developing countries. She also told US senators: The “buck stops” with the founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg. Facebook knows its systems lead teenagers to anorexia-related content. The company had to “break the glass” and turn back on safety settings after the 6 January Washington riot. Facebook intentionally targets teenagers and children under 13. Monday’s outage that brought down Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp meant that for more than five hours Facebook could not “destabilise democracies”. Haugen appeared in Washington on Tuesday after coming forward as the source of a series of revelations in the Wall Street Journal last month based on internal Facebook documents. They revealed the company knew Instagram was damaging teenagers’ mental health and that changes to Facebook’s News Feed feature – a central plank of users’ interaction with the service – had made the platform more polarising and divisive. She told senators on Tuesday that Facebook knew Instagram users were being led to anorexia-related content. She said an algorithm “led children from very innocuous topics like healthy recipes … all the way to anorexia-promoting content over a very short period of time”. In her opening testimony, Haugen, 37, said: “I’m here today because I believe Facebook’s products harm children, stoke division and weaken our democracy. The company’s leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won’t make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people.” She added that Facebook was “buying its profits with our safety”. In 2020, Facebook reported a net income – a US measure of profit – of more than $29bn (£21bn). Referring to Monday’s near six-hour outage in which Facebook’s platforms including Instagram and WhatsApp were disabled for billions of users, Haugen’s testimony added: “For more than five hours Facebook wasn’t used to deepen divides, destabilise democracies and make young girls and women feel bad about their bodies.” Facebook has 3.5 billion monthly active users across its platforms including Instagram and WhatsApp. Warning that Facebook makes choices that “go against the common good”, Haugen said the company should be treated like the tobacco industry, which was subject to government action once it was discovered it was hiding the harms its products caused, or like car companies that were forced to adopt seatbelts or opioid firms that have been sued by government agencies. Urging lawmakers to force more transparency on Facebook, she said there should be more scrutiny of its algorithms, which shape the content delivered to users. “The core of the issue is that no one can understand Facebook’s destructive choices better than Facebook, because only Facebook gets to look under the hood,” she said. With greater transparency, she added, “we can build sensible rules and standards to address consumer harms, illegal content, data protection, anticompetitive practices, algorithmic systems and more”. The hearing focused on the impact of Facebook’s platforms on children, with Haugen likening the appeal of Instagram to tobacco. “It’s just like cigarettes … teenagers don’t have good self-regulation.” Haugen added women would be walking around with brittle bones in 60 years’ time because of the anorexia-related content they found on Facebook platforms. Haugen told lawmakers that Facebook intentionally targets teens and “definitely” targets children as young as eight for the Messenger Kids app. Haugen said that, according to internal documents, Zuckerberg had been given “soft options” to make the Facebook platform less “twitchy” and viral in countries prone to violence but declined to take them because it might affect “meaningful social interactions”, or MSI. She added: “We have a few choice documents that contain notes from briefings with Mark Zuckerberg where he chose metrics defined by Facebook like ‘meaningful social interactions’ over changes that would have significantly decreased misinformation, hate speech and other inciting content.” Haugen said Zuckerberg had built a company that was “very metrics driven”, because the more time people spent on Facebook platforms the more appealing the business was to advertisers. Asked about Zuckerberg’s ultimate responsibility for decisions made at Facebook, she said: “The buck stops with him.” Haugen also warned that Facebook was “literally fanning ethnic violence” in places such as Ethiopia because it was not policing its service adequately outside the US. Referring to the aftermath of the 6 January storming of the Capitol, as protesters sought to overturn the US presidential election result, Haugen said she was disturbed that Facebook had to “break the glass” and reinstate safety settings that it had put in place for the November poll. Haugen, who worked for the Facebook team that monitored election interference globally, said those precautions had been dropped after Joe Biden’s victory in order to spur growth on the platform. Among the reforms recommended by Haugen were ensuring that Facebook shares internal information and research with “appropriate” oversight bodies such as Congress and removing the influence of algorithms on Facebook’s News Feed by allowing it to be ranked chronologically. “Frances Haugen’s testimony appears to mark a rare moment of bipartisan consensus that the status quo is no longer acceptable,” said Imran Ahmed, chief executive officer of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a non-profit that fights hate speech and misinformation. “This is increasingly becoming a non-political issue and one that has cut through definitively to the mainstream.” Haugen’s testimony is likely to add pressure on US lawmakers to attempt legislative measures against the tech company. Senator Ed Markey suggested during the hearing that Congress would take action. “Here’s my message for Mark Zuckerberg: your time of invading our privacy, promoting toxic content in preying on children and teens is over,” Markey said. “Congress will be taking action. We will not allow your company to harm our children and our families and our democracy, any longer.” “Today’s testimony from Frances Haugen is a catalyst for change,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar. “The time for action is now.” Haugen’s lawyers have filed at least eight complaints with the US financial watchdog accusing the social media company of serially misleading investors about its approach to safety and the size of its audience. Facebook has pushed back forcefully against Haugen’s accusations. In a blogpost published on Tuesday evening, Mark Zuckerberg said it was “difficult to see coverage that misrepresents our work and our motives”. “At the heart of these accusations is this idea that we prioritize profit over safety and wellbeing. That’s just not true,” the Facebook CEO wrote, going on to cite the company’s work to overhaul its News Feed to focus on “meaningful social interactions”, and saying that internal research about the effects of Instagram on young people had been “mischaracterized”. Though her testimony was built on thousands of internal documents gathered from the company, a company spokesperson, Andy Stone, said in a tweet during the hearing: “Just pointing out the fact that Frances Haugen did not work on child safety or Instagram or research these issues and has no direct knowledge of the topic from her work at Facebook.” Responding after the hearing, Lena Pietsch, Facebook’s director of policy communications, said: “Today, a Senate commerce subcommittee held a hearing with a former product manager at Facebook who worked for the company for less than two years, had no direct reports, never attended a decision-point meeting with C-level executives and testified more than six times to not working on the subject matter in question. We don’t agree with her characterization of the many issues she testified about. “Despite all this, we agree on one thing; it’s time to begin to create standard rules for the internet. It’s been 25 years since the rules for the internet have been updated, and instead of expecting the industry to make societal decisions that belong to legislators, it is time for Congress to act.” Earlier, Facebook had issued a series of statements downplaying Haugen’s document leaks, saying: its Instagram research showed that many teenagers found the app helpful; it was investing heavily in security at the expense of its bottom line; polarisation had been growing in the US for decades before Facebook appeared; and the company had “made fighting misinformation and providing authoritative information a priority”. Responding to accusations that Facebook had misled the public and regulators, the company said: “We stand by our public statements and are ready to answer any questions regulators may have about our work.”","She added: “We have a few choice documents that contain notes from briefings with Mark Zuckerberg where he chose metrics defined by Facebook like ‘meaningful social interactions’ over changes that would have significantly decreased misinformation, hate speech and other inciting content.” Haugen said Zuckerberg had built a company that was “very metrics driven”, because the more time people spent on Facebook platforms the more appealing the business was to advertisers.

John was born in Liverpool and grew up in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, the son of Ethel (nee Grain), a teacher, and John Owen, a tailor’s cutter and a Co-operative and Labour party councillor. After attaining the best Higher School Certificate for science in his year from Burton grammar school, he gained a physics degree (1952) at the University of Birmingham. Then at the Manchester College of Technology (which later became Umist), he qualified with the Institution of Electrical Engineers. He was apprenticed to Metropolitan Vickers (now part of the the General Electric Company), in Trafford Park, to work as a part of the team that developed a new electron microscope. In 1967 John was transferred to the fledgling new town of Harlow to continue working on it in a new factory to meet international demand. In 1974 he began a long and successful career with the British Standards Institution (BSI) in London, where, eight years later, he was made a principal technical officer. It suited him perfectly, combining his meticulous demand for accuracy and detail, his desire to make the world a safer place, and his ability to work collaboratively with others. He travelled around the globe developing and agreeing standards as part of international standards committees. Retiring from the BSI in 1994, he took over the secretariat of two International Standards Organisation committees, funded by the Environment Agency and the Department of Trade and Industry, concerned with water flow in open channels – rivers and streams, notches, weirs and flumes. His work helped standardise the technical ways used to measure water flow; this was necessary to test water levels to avoid impacts such as flooding. Aside from his intelligence and hard work, John was a modest, quiet, kind and unselfish man. He adored being a father and a grandfather. He brought up his three daughters to think that men and women really were equal – he was equally at ease rewiring the house as kneading a batch of loaves. The latter he continued to do weekly until three weeks before his death. In 1957 he married Elaine Cartwright. She survives him, along with their three daughters, Rosalind, Laura and me, seven grandchildren, and his younger brother, Ray.","John was born in Liverpool and grew up in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, the son of Ethel (nee Grain), a teacher, and John Owen, a tailor’s cutter and a Co-operative and Labour party councillor.

The Fauna audio glasses come in a range of designs with clear and tinted lenses costing from £199 (€199/$199) – shown here in Spiro transparent brown – and unlike some competitors they can be equipped with prescription lenses and fitted to your head by an optician. As Bose proved with its first Frames, the big benefit of having speakers in glasses is situational awareness. You don’t need earbuds blocking the world out when you have the open-air sound of tiny speakers next to your ears, which means you can still hear the traffic, bikes, birds and bees as you walk about. The Fauna glasses get the basics right. They look good. The arms are noticeably smaller than the Bose Frames and only a little bit chunkier than regular glasses. They only weight about 15g more than a set of sunglasses too. They’re comfortable to wear for extended periods, are rain resistant and don’t look like a piece of technology strapped to your face. They also don’t try to do too much: there’s no camera, no always-listening voice assistant or a display. Fauna has borrowed ideas from true wireless earbuds too. There’s no cable connecting each side of the glasses; instead each stem connects to your phone directly via Bluetooth, and the case doubles as an on-the-go charger. Take the glasses out of the case and they automatically connect to your phone. They last up to four hours of music playback or 12 hours of standby, while the case can charge the glasses four times. Sound The Fauna sound good for open-ear headphones, significantly better than bone conduction and similar techniques about on a level with the Bose Frames. They produce an open and airy sound by design, with pretty detailed highs and mids, but a complete lack of bass. They don’t sound tinny, but they do lack the fullness of sound that you might expect from a good set of earbuds. That’s because you still need larger speakers or a good seal in your ear for that sort of audio quality. Set to 40% they are loud enough for listening indoors and get really quite loud at maximum volume, which is needed when walking alongside a busy road. They do leak sound, but only people sitting in very close proximity will be able to hear the music if kept below 40% volume. There’s something very nice about a little bit of background music to walks through the park in the sun while still being able to hear the squawks of London’s ring-necked parakeets overhead and the thump and cheer of kids playing football in the distance. Call quality is very good, with my voice coming across clear and natural sounding in quiet environments and with little background noise in louder places. Note the microphone is only activated when on a call or when activity speaking to your phone’s voice assistant. Sustainability Fauna estimates the batteries in the glasses will maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for 500 full charge cycles. The battery in the case will maintain at least 60% of its original capacity after 500 cycles. The frame and lenses of the Fauna glasses are replaceable, but the temples cannot be repaired and the batteries cannot be replaced, ultimately making them disposable. The case can be disassembled but Fauna does not offer repair services. The glasses do not contain recycled material nor does Fauna operate a trade-in or recycling scheme in the UK. The company does not publish environmental impact assessments. Observations There’s no way to turn them off without the case, so you can’t just put them on without turning them on. The glasses speak to you in the third-person telling you they’re on, when connected or in pairing mode. A couple of times the glasses refused to reconnect to a phone, requiring a force repairing. Price The Fauna audio glasses are available in clear and tinted lenses starting at £199 (€199) with the Spiro Transparent Brown as tested. For comparison, the Bose Frames cost £239.95, Apple’s AirPods cost £159 and Google’s Pixel Buds A-Series cost £99.99. Verdict The Fauna audio glasses are a stylish set of sunglasses with built-in speakers in for open-air listening. They sound good for what they are, are well designed and comfortable, last up to four hours, charge in their case and don’t look too different from a regular set of glasses. An optician can change the lenses and reshape the frame for your face, too. But like other audio glasses they can’t beat a set of earbuds on sound and their primary benefit – being able to hear the world around you – makes them hard to hear on busy streets. The glasses are not repairable nor can the batteries be replaced, however, ultimately making them disposable and losing a star. Pros: music without blocking your ears or making a racket for others, look good, choice of lenses and frames, comfortable, sound good, solid Bluetooth connection, excellent call quality, charge in case. Cons: will never be your only set of earphones, can’t match earbuds for sound, can’t protect from noise of the outside world, cannot be repaired or replace the battery.

33,33,"Pamela Paul must be one of the last subscribers to the branch of Netflix that allows its users to see films via the stone-age practice of receiving DVDs in the post. I know this because, two days after we talk, she sends me a blurry photograph of her last hire – The Anniversary Party, a 2001 comedy starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Alan Cumming – along with a Q&amp;A she did for the New York Times, about the art of what she calls “sliding backward on tech”. Its basic point is summarised in one of Paul’s characteristic bits of aphoristic wisdom: “In general, when I hear the phrase ‘There’s an app for that’, my first question is: ‘Does there need to be?’” Paul, 50, is the editor of the New York Times Book Review. She does not use any streaming services. As late as 2019, she bought – read this slowly – portable CD players for two of her children. As a matter of principle, she refuses to own or use anything resembling a tablet, except her phone. “I don’t want a tablet,” she says, her face adopting an expression of mild disgust. “People have tried to give me a tablet; I want nothing to do with that tablet. I would probably have to be paid a salary of, like, $250,000 a year to use a Kindle or an iPad to read on. It would be that unpleasant.” This is not quite the expression of luddite fundamentalism it might seem. Paul’s professional life is just as tech-heavy as most other people’s. She says her working hours are “a cascade of Zooms”, while her fairly prolific tweeting is not suggestive of someone who lives in a cave. But she does maintain a personal existence partly rooted in the pre-internet age. Moreover, she is old enough – like me – to recall clearly what life was like in those far-off times, and to feel a nagging sense of loss about what the online world has rendered useless and irrelevant. This is the context for her latest book, 100 Things We’ve Lost to the Internet. Its form seems to fit an era of short attention spans, breaking up its author’s writing into short essays with headings such as “Solitude”, “Ignoring people”, “Leaving a message” and “A parent’s undivided attention”. At its best, the book reads like it mixes journalism with sociology and anthropology. To its credit, it also manages the rare feat of exploring what technology has done to us without succumbing to doom and panic. We talk for an hour on a video call and one thing quickly becomes clear: Paul is the kind of freewheeling conversationalist who was always going to feel a little adrift in a world of one-line texts, emojis and the disappearance of the long, digressive phone conversation. “There are a lot of terrible things to say about the internet,” she says. “What I wanted to focus on was not so much all of those doomsday scenarios, although they exist, but to look at all of these forces and say: ‘What does this mean for what we do in our daily lives – from the moment we wake up to the iPhone alarm to the moment when we’re trying to fall asleep at night and we can’t because we’re like: ‘Oh my God, there’s this newsletter that arrives at 11pm, let me just see what it says’? What does it actually mean down here at the level of how we live?” *** Paul has been an author for nearly 20 years, specialising in what she calls “the intersection of consumer culture and real life”. Her first book, published in 2002, was about what she called “starter marriages” – the trend for many people’s first experience of matrimony to be short and childless – and how this was partly traceable to the massive wedding industry. Three years later came a prescient work titled Pornified, which focused on one of the internet’s most pernicious aspects; it was subtitled “How pornography is transforming our lives, our relationships and our families”. Parenting Inc, from 2008, was about the consumerisation of raising kids. By way of offering an antidote of some kind, her 2019 book How To Raise a Reader – written with her NYT colleague Maria Russo – was a straightforward guide to pulling children away from screens and encouraging the declining habit of getting immersed in books. 100 Things draws on themes that have run through a lot of her work. It applies an appealing humour and light touch, and tells a vivid story: how, in little more than 20 years, we have shed ingrained social and behavioural habits, as well as some of the most basic ways we once thought of ourselves and our relationships with others. If they are minded to read it, anyone under 40 will presumably understand the book as the evocation of a strange, slow, endlessly inconvenient reality that now feels almost exotic. For anyone older, it will deliver a sense of loss – and of being old enough to remember times that seem almost hilariously distant. One of Paul’s talents is the ability to see big change in lots of small ones. She writes about the end of talking to strangers on aeroplanes; the increasingly lost human habit of staring out of windows; and why no one bothers to remember phone numbers any more. In one particularly ingenious entry, she explains the demise of the full stop (or, in American English, the “period”). If you have ever wondered why putting such once-crucial punctation in emails, phone messages or tweets now feels so awkward, here is the answer: “The period can feel so emphatic as to sound sarcastic, the internet’s version of ‘puh-leeze’ and ‘no, thank you’ and ‘srsly’ rolled into one tiny dot.” It can easily come across as passive-aggressive. Exclamation marks, moreover, “now convey warmth and sincerity”; failing to use them runs the risk of making the person you are messaging feel uncertain and anxious. Such small transformations, Paul explains, arrive without warning and magnify a sense of everything being in flux. For fear of becoming social outcasts, most people feel they have little option but to try frantically to keep up. On the day we speak, Mark Zuckerberg has just announced the rebranding of Facebook’s holding company as Meta and premiered the virtual reality hellscape the company is calling the metaverse. “We are all desperately trying to stay on top of things,” says Paul. “Right now, we’re going to have to be on top of the metaverse or we’ll have to opt out of it altogether. But we’re constantly moving forward: ‘Should I do this thing? How come I don’t know about that app? I haven’t adopted it.’ “What we never do is take a step back and say: ‘Wait a minute – what did we use to do here? How did this use to work?’ And what’s crazy is we’ve become so quickly habituated. We’ve adopted all these new habits and completely forgotten how we used to get around – literally, how we used to get around. How did we do it when we didn’t have GPS? Oh yeah, we used to have those huge fold-out maps that you could never fold back properly. But we’ve forgotten that. No one uses those any more. And no one knows how to get anywhere without a device.” Recently, she read a century-old book by the US novelist Edith Wharton, A Motor-Flight Through France, which was written partly as an exploration of how much human existence had been changed by the invention of the car. “That was occasion enough to write an entirely new travelogue about a country she’d written about before – because suddenly you were no longer beholden to trains and so you could go down different routes and you didn’t have to rely on a schedule. And now, you just think about the tininess of that change, really, relative to the ways in which everything has altered in the last 20 years. That was considered to be a monumental shift. But it’s nothing compared with what we’ve been through in the last 20 years.” A key part of the internet’s behavioural and psychological revolution is the subject of the book’s opening entry: boredom, the decline of which has radically altered childhood (as any parent will know). “Only a few short decades ago, during the lost age of underparenting, grownups thought a certain amount of boredom was appropriate, even to be encouraged, because it forced kids to exercise their imagination and ingenuity,” Paul writes. “A little ennui would make a person less bored in the long run.” “Boredom serves a function,” she says now. “It’s boring, obviously, and we don’t like that, but, when you have no input coming in, you generate output. That’s how you become resourceful. But now you constantly have access to information, entertainment, distraction – all of this stuff coming in, coming in and coming in. And it doesn’t allow you the empty space to create something, or to just process something. “I spent so much time in the back seat of my parents’ car bored out of my skull. There was nothing to do. Then your brain wanders and you think about things. Now, every kid in the car has their own device and they’re listening to their own music or their own audiobook or their own podcasts, or they’re playing a video game or they’re swiping through social media, or they’re taking a million and one pictures of themselves and snapping them up to Snapchat. I don’t know why. How many times can you look at people’s faces?” In a roundabout way, this brings us to something that the book explores a lot: the sense that most of us live in front of a constant audience, with few benefits to show for it. “I feel like what’s happened is that everyone is living the emotional lives of famous people, constantly needing to react to this world that is so much larger than the actual human world that they otherwise would be inhabiting. And I think that is really emotionally and psychologically hard to handle, in the same way that it’s hard to handle for a celebrity. They’re lucky that they get to be rich and probably beautiful on top of that and have lots of privileges. But most of us, frankly, don’t.” *** Paul’s book is not quite the endless lament our conversation suggests. Some of its entries are full of ambivalence: being able to “Google the hell out of someone” in advance of a blind date might rob the occasion of its mystery, but it is surely all to the good; the modern impossibility of getting lost might sometimes mean that we don’t “succumb to chance and make our own discoveries”, but it has its upsides. There is also material about things surely no one will miss: chequebooks, old-school encyclopedias, the Filofax (note to younger readers: ask your parents). Nonetheless, her most poignant, thought-provoking points are about things we should not throw overboard with the enthusiasm that the tech industry wants us to – and, by implication, about the necessity of what she calls “microrebellions”. Besides her CD players and rented DVDs, there is another obvious example. “Well, look here,” she says. She pulls her computer to her left and my screen is filled with the image of thousands of books. She thinks for a moment. “Do you know what the way I think about all this is? I am highly technological in my day job, because I have to be. And then, in my personal life, rather than the default being opt-in, my default is opting out. I will only adopt something if I really think it’s going to improve my life in some substantial way.” Here, perhaps, is a modern paradox. We embrace the internet because it seems to hugely increase our autonomy, but the online world soon gives us the sense that, when it comes to what it offers us, we have no meaningful choices at all. The only thing to do is to drop the old, embrace the new and live with the consequences. “We have the option to say: I don’t want that product,” says Paul. “I don’t actually have to pay by [the mobile payment service] Venmo. I don’t need PayPal. I don’t have to get my books from an online retailer. There are other ways of doing these things. It’s a choice. Buying or not buying a pair of jeans or a new skin cream – those are all options, too. And yet, for some reason, with technology, we forget that we have control.” 100 Things We’ve Lost to the Internet by Pamela Paul (Random House USA, £14.99) is out now.

34,34,"The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said it tackled a record number of cyber incidents in the UK over the last year, with ransomware attacks originating from Russia dominating its activities. The cybersecurity agency said it had helped deal with a 7.5% increase in cases in the year to August, fuelled by the surge of criminal hackers seizing control of corporate data and demanding payment in cryptocurrency for its return. Paul Chichester, director of operations, said that “ransomware has certainly dominated a significant portion of year” and that the hacking epidemic had become “global as a story in the last 12 months”. Criminal hackers, based in Russia or in nearby Russian speaking territories, successfully targeted organisations such as the London borough of Hackney and the celebrity jeweller Graff in the UK in the past year. In May, in the US, oil and gas supplier Colonial Pipeline suspended operations after a ransomware attack left it unable to access key data. It eventually paid $5m (£3.7m) to the hackers to regain control of its systems. Central government and the UK public sector do not pay cyber ransoms, although fixing the damage can take months. Rebuilding Hackney’s affected systems cost around £10m, with some of the costs met by central government. However, NCSC officials said they had no power to prevent the payment of ransoms – often around £1m a time – by businesses to hackers, even though doing so ensured the criminal activity continued. “We would say we would prefer people not to pay because that’s what keeps the UK safest collectively,” said Lindy Cameron, the director of the organisation, who acknowledged that commercial pressures meant some businesses felt they had little choice to meet the hackers’ demands for money. British ministers and officials have considered banning cyber ransom payments, but it is understood that is unlikely to be implemented, partly because of concern it would discourage businesses from reporting attacks. Many companies are able to claim on their cyber insurance, although once hackers have access to a corporate system they can seek the insurance policy to work out how much the company is able to pay. Last month the head UK spy agency GCHQ, NCSC’s parent organisation, disclosed that the number of ransomware attacks on British institutions has doubled in the past year. The impact on the British economy is estimated to run into the hundreds of millions of pounds, mostly stemming from the costs of immobilising businesses.","The cybersecurity agency said it had helped deal with a 7.5% increase in cases in the year to August, fuelled by the surge of criminal hackers seizing control of corporate data and demanding payment in cryptocurrency for its return.

35,35,"It’s risky for me to boldly state that technology news has quietened down in recent weeks. For one thing, confidently saying that nothing much is going on is the best way to summon up a news event breaking 15 seconds after I hit “send” on this email. Also, though, I’m currently sitting at home up to my eyeballs in parental leave. While I’m still compulsively keeping up with every tiny news story that breaks in my sector (if I could simply switch off that instinct, I wouldn’t be doing this job), I’m aware that my connection to many of them is less vivid than it used to be when I was desperately trying to find a new angle to move the story on for that day’s paper. My daughter’s just reached the age where she’s noticed that screens exist, and have moving images on them, and sometimes (too often, if I’m honest) occupy her beloved father’s attention that could be better focused on her. As with everything in a baby’s life, the solution is simple: chew it. Which is why the story that most caught my eye this week was the news that Apple is, for the first time ever, going to let users repair their own iPhones. From the company’s press release: Apple today announced Self Service Repair, which will allow customers who are comfortable with completing their own repairs access to Apple genuine parts and tools. Available first for the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 lineups, and soon to be followed by Mac computers featuring M1 chips, Self Service Repair will be available early next year in the US and expand to additional countries throughout 2022. Customers join more than 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers (AASPs) and 2,800 Independent Repair Providers who have access to these parts, tools, and manuals. Apple’s devices are infamously hard to repair. The company decided decades ago that customers like sleek, beautiful devices without a visible screw in sight – even if that means that they have no ability to repair it at home. In 2021, that’s par for the course among consumer technology companies, but once upon a time it was a uniquely Apple proposition: iFixit, a company which provides repair kits and manuals for a host of consumer electronics, got started in 2003 when the site’s founders discovered there were no instructions on how to repair a broken iBook. Since then, the trade-off has become ever-more stark. That 2003 iBook may have been missing a manual or two, but the computer was largely assembled using open technologies and off-the-shelf parts: if you could work out how to access the hard-drive, RAM or screen, you could probably fix it by swapping them out with another part bought online, or at least cannibalised from a similar machine. But as technology has progressed, that’s become less and less true. Home improvements The screen on a top-end iPhone isn’t just an incredibly small, high-resolution display that simply isn’t for sale to normal people; it’s also part of a single unit that includes the front-facing camera, FaceID scanner, microphone and speaker. And if you can, very carefully, separate out those parts, you may still find that your repair fails, as security solutions implemented in the phone’s software reject your new part for fear of tampering. Over the years, there’s been understandable cynicism about Apple’s motivations. Every person who buys a new iPhone rather than repairing an old one is more money in Apple’s pocket, after all. And every person who is forced to take their phone to the company and pay for the repair directly is an opportunity for it to charge an eye-watering mark-up on the parts and labour. You don’t become the world’s most valuable company by being nice. For what it’s worth, I think some of the cynicism is probably unfair. For years, consumers really did vote with their wallets, buying smaller, sleeker hardware even if it was held together by superglue rather than screws. Elsewhere, Apple seems to do the right thing when it comes to keeping older hardware working – for instance, iOS 15, the latest version of the company’s operating system, runs on a six-year-old iPhone 6s. For comparison, Google’s Pixel, released the same year, received its final ever update almost two years ago. The reality seems to be that Apple just doesn’t care about at-home repairability, for good or ill. It may not go out of its way to hinder it, but it certainly hasn’t gone out of its way to help it in the past. So what’s changed? Why is Apple suddenly willing to ship parts and manuals to users? There’s a simple enough answer, I think: it’s the threat of regulation. You’ve got to fight for your right … to repair Apple isn’t the only company to steadily chip away at repairs. Where the iPhone has led, others have followed, in such numbers that “repairable phone” is now a viable niche market for smaller companies such as Fairphone to compete in. And it’s not just tech: tractor company John Deere has become infamous for the restrictions it puts on its vehicles, sold to farmers who are used to being able to tinker with a machine long enough to pass it on to their own children and suddenly find that they can barely even pop the bonnet without a laptop provided by an authorised repair centre. And so lawmakers around the world have started to propose legislation enshrining a “right to repair”. Those laws run the gamut from mild restrictions preventing companies from actively hindering attempts to repair their products, all the way to strong requirements that companies not only allow repairs, but support and design around the need to be able to fix things at home. If Apple and its peers want to avoid being hit by those laws, they need to release some of the pressure on lawmakers. Hence the self-repair programme, which is perfectly targeted to quiet the loudest voices. Most people, even with these kits, will be unable – or unwilling – to attempt a repair of an iPhone at home. It’s fiddly work, and for most pressing repairs, such as the screen or motherboard, the parts will still be well north of $100. But if you’ve heard of the “right to repair” movement, you’re probably one of the subsection of society that’s willing to get a “spudger” out in a time of need. And there will be real benefits for some. If you can’t do without your phone or laptop for even a day, the ability to repair it yourself, rather than drop it off at a centre and get it back 24 hours later, could be meaningfully transformative. And, of course, repairing your own machine also means you don’t have to hand over your password to anyone else – avoiding horror stories like this, from June: The unnamed woman sent her iPhone for repair on 14 January 2016 to an Apple-approved repair contractor called Pegatron Technology Service in California. Technicians there then uploaded “extremely personal and private material” to the woman’s Facebook account and other internet locations, the documents said. The videos were uploaded to appear as though the woman herself had shared them on purpose, according to the documents, causing the woman “severe emotional distress”. The woman was made aware of the incident when friends saw the videos and images on Facebook. Weak constitution News from cryptocurrency land is at its best when it’s dumb fun, and there’s no dumber fun that the failed attempt on the part of more than 10 thousand people to buy a copy of the US constitution: The document, one of 13 original copies dating from 1787, sold for almost three times its lower estimate of $15m, and more than 260 times the amount it achieved when it last sold for $165,000 in 1988. The bidding at Sotheby’s in New York took eight minutes. “ConstitutionDAO” had amassed more than £47m, or 11,600 of the cryptocurrency ether, in a few days on its online crowdfunding page. The group, which had committed to putting the document on public display “in the hands of the people”, promised to refund its 17,437 contributors after deducting transaction fees. The caper was effectively a Twitter meme or Reddit shitpost brought to life – and given a multimillion dollar budget. A small group of crypto fans spotted that the copy of the constitution, the only one in private hands, was about to be sold off, and the instituted a plan to raise funds to buy it and display it in public. The project was dubbed ConstutionDAO, a spin on a popular form of crypto project called a “decentralised autonomous organisation”. Those projects can be thought of as automated hedge funds, where shareholders have the ability to directly influence the direction of the funds’ activity using contracts built directly into the code that set it up. But ConstutionDAO had little in common with those. In reality, the project was fatally flawed from day one, by virtue of the simple fact that it had to interact with the real world. In order to buy the copy of the constitution, the plan stated, a limited company would need to be set up, since a DAO can’t legally own conventional property. That company would then need human directors, and while it could offer shares, they would need to be conventionally allocated, since a cryptocurrency can’t legally act as a security in the US. And then, since the body was in receipt of millions of dollars with a clear and stated aim, even the DAO itself was recentralised, with the original eight founders keeping direct control of how its funds were used in order to prevent someone simply taking control of the organisation and redeploying its cash elsewhere. When your DAO is DOA What the thousands of people who crowdfunded the attempt to buy the constitution were actually buying with their money is unclear: minority ownership of an organisation that would not in fact own the constitution, but was controlled by some people who also owned a limited company that hoped to buy the constitution at auction. The parallels with the wider NFT bubble should be clear. The world of cryptocurrency is great at producing a tangled web of interrelated products and services, but terrible at interacting with anything outside that network: an NFT isn’t ownership of anything but itself, a record on the blockchain proves nothing except the fact that someone wrote it on to the blockchain, and an organisation expressly set up to buy the constitution would not, in fact, own the constitution. That is, if it had managed to buy the document in the first case. What actually happened is that the group learned that going into an auction with a clear and obvious budget that you are functionally unable to exceed is probably bad strategy: they were outbid by Ken Griffin, the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel, who went into the auction knowing to the dollar the amount he had to spend to gain a victory over the upstarts. “The U.S. Constitution is a sacred document that enshrines the rights of every American and all those who aspire to be,” Griffin said in a statement. “That is why I intend to ensure that this copy of our Constitution will be available for all Americans and visitors to view and appreciate in our museums and other public spaces.” He’s placing it in … a museum founded by Walmart heiress Alice Walton. As a poetic ending to an attempt to overturn the power structures of the American state, it’s hard to beat. … until the coda came along. On Tuesday evening, ConstitutionDAO announced it was shutting down entirely. “We know that everyone is eager to hear what the next steps for ConstitutionDAO are, and we’ve been deeply exploring several options for this over the last four days,” the project’s leaders posted. “While we would very much like to have been able to do so, we have determined that building and maintaining an ongoing project is not something that we as a core team are able to support, given the technical and administrative requirements of doing it properly.” The team encouraged everyone who’d funded the project to apply for refunds, a request that’s easier said than done: for many of the small-dollar donations to the fundraiser, the transaction fees on the ethereum blockchain dwarf the actual amount refunded. Anyone with less than around $100 in the project is likely to see nothing refunded at all.

36,36,"Google’s Irish subsidiary has agreed to pay €218m (£183m) in back taxes to the Irish government, according to company filings. The US tech company, which had been accused of avoiding hundreds of millions in tax across Europe through loopholes known as the “double Irish, Dutch sandwich”, said it had “agreed to the resolution of certain tax matters relating to prior years”. Google Ireland said it would pay corporation tax of €622m for 2020, including the €218m backdated settlement and interest charges. The previous year Google Ireland paid taxes of €263m. In line with a 2015 law, the company, which is part of the parent company Alphabet, promised last year that it would ditch the loopholes strategy, which allowed it to effectively shuffle revenues made across Europe offshore to places like Bermuda, where the tax rate was zero. A Bloomberg investigation showed the scheme allowed Google to cut its overseas tax rate to just 2.4%. Google did not explain the reason for the back tax payment in its accounts and did not respond to request for comment. In the filing it said only: “Subsequent to year-end, the company agreed to the resolution of certain tax matters relating to prior years. This tax liability and associated interest are recognised in the current financial year.” Paul Monaghan, the chief executive of the Fair Tax Foundation, said: “There really is a disgraceful lack of transparency around Alphabet’s tax conduct, especially at the level of the Irish subsidiaries. Stakeholders have a right to know what this Irish corporation tax settlement relates to. “Investors in particular should be concerned given Alphabet’s US filings show that it has billions more in dispute with tax authorities around the globe in circumstances where, by its own definition, it has less than 50% chance of winning.” Ireland, which has provided low-tax European headquarters for many of the world’s largest multinationals, initially declined to sign up to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development agreement for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% by 2023, but dropped its resistance to the plan after a change to the text. The agreement, which has been joined by most of 140 countries taking part in negotiations, is designed to end decades of countries undercutting their neighbours by offering companies lower taxes. The accounts show Google Ireland Limited made a pre-tax profit of €2.85bn in 2020, up from €1.94bn in 2019. Turnover rose by €2.7bn to €48.4bn.","The US tech company, which had been accused of avoiding hundreds of millions in tax across Europe through loopholes known as the “double Irish, Dutch sandwich”, said it had “agreed to the resolution of certain tax matters relating to prior years”.

37,37,"Chinese hackers could target heavily encrypted datasets such as weapon designs or details of undercover intelligence officers with a view to unlocking them at a later date when quantum computing makes decryption possible, a report warns. Analysts at Booz Allen Hamilton, a consulting firm, say Chinese hackers could also steal pharmaceutical, chemical and material science research that can be processed by quantum computers – machines capable of crunching through numbers at unprecedented speed. In a report titled “Chinese threats in the quantum era”, the consultancy says encrypted data could be stolen by “Chinese threat groups”. It says quantum-assisted decryption will arrive faster than quantum-assisted encryption, giving hackers an edge. “Encrypted data with intelligence longevity, like biometric markers, covert intelligence officer and source identities, social security numbers, and weapons’ designs, may be increasingly stolen under the expectation that they can eventually be decrypted,” the report says. It says “state-aligned cyber threat actors” will start to steal or intercept previously unusable encrypted data. However, it adds there is a “very small” likelihood that quantum computing could break the latest encryption methods before 2030. The analysts say quantum computing’s advantages over classical computing – the computing used in everything from laptops to mobile phones – are at least a decade away. “Although quantum computers’ current abilities are more demonstrative than immediately useful, their trajectory suggests that in the coming decades quantum computers will likely revolutionize numerous industries – from pharmaceuticals to materials science – and eventually undermine all popular current public-key encryption methods,” the report says. Quantum computing is viewed as an exciting development. For example, experts say it could predict accurately what a complex molecule might do and thus pave the way for new drugs and materials. China is already a strong player in the field, and Booz Allen Hamilton says it expected the country to surpass Europe and the US – where IBM recently made the most powerful quantum processor – in quantum-related research and development. “Chinese threat groups will likely soon collect encrypted data with long-term utility, expecting to eventually decrypt it with quantum computers,” the report says. “By the end of the 2020s, Chinese threat groups will likely collect data that enables quantum simulators to discover new economically valuable materials, pharmaceuticals and chemicals.”","In a report titled “Chinese threats in the quantum era”, the consultancy says encrypted data could be stolen by “Chinese threat groups”. “Encrypted data with intelligence longevity, like biometric markers, covert intelligence officer and source identities, social security numbers, and weapons’ designs, may be increasingly stolen under the expectation that they can eventually be decrypted,” the report says. “Although quantum computers’ current abilities are more demonstrative than immediately useful, their trajectory suggests that in the coming decades quantum computers will likely revolutionize numerous industries – from pharmaceuticals to materials science – and eventually undermine all popular current public-key encryption methods,” the report says.

38,38,"Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has stepped down from his executive role at the social media company. Dorsey will be replaced by chief technology officer (CTO) Parag Agrawal, the company announced on Monday. The surprise move ends Dorsey’s much criticized tenure as chief executive officer of both Twitter and Square, his digital payments company, which led to Twitter stakeholders Elliott Management and billionaire investor Paul Singer calling on him to step down from one of those roles. Twitter’s shares rose 11% after the news broke on CNBC before being briefly suspended. The company said Dorsey would step down immediately but that Dorsey would remain on the board until Twitter’s stockholder meeting in 2022. “I’ve decided to leave Twitter because I believe the company is ready to move on from its founders. My trust in Parag as Twitter’s CEO is deep. His work over the past 10 years has been transformational. I’m deeply grateful for his skill, heart and soul. It’s his time to lead,” said Dorsey. Agrawal has been with Twitter for a decade and served as CTO since 2017. “I want to thank the board for their confidence in my leadership and Jack for his continued mentorship, support and partnership,” said Agrawal. In his most recent tweet on the site, posted Sunday, Dorsey wrote: “I love Twitter.” In an email to staff on Monday Dorsey wrote that after 16 years at the company, it was time to leave. “There’s a lot of talk about the importance of a company being ‘founder-led’. Ultimately I believe that’s severely limiting and a single point of failure,” he wrote. “I’ve worked hard to ensure this company can break away from its founding and founders.” Dorsey said Agrawal was his preferred choice for CEO. “My trust in him as CEO is bone-deep,” he wrote. “I want you all to know this was my decision and I own it.” Dorsey, 45, co-founded the microblogging site in 2006 and posted the world’s first tweet: “Just setting up my twttr.” He co-founded Square in 2009 after being pushed out of the top job at Twitter before returning as chief executive of the social media company in 2015. Investors and some staff have questioned Dorsey’s management style and have worried that he is stretched too thin by his roles at both companies. In 2019 he announced plans to relocate to Africa for six months, a move that worried both staff and investors. He scrapped the plan after the coronavirus pandemic struck. Dorsey also set off a political firestorm following Twitter’s decision to ban former president Donald Trump from the platform. He later defended the move as the “right decision” but said it also highlighted “a failure of ours, ultimately, to promote healthy conversation”. His stakes in Twitter and Square have helped Dorsey amass a personal fortune of over $12bn, according to Forbes. In April Dorsey announced he was giving $1bn to relief programs related to the coronavirus, “girls’ health and education”, and the study of universal basic income (UBI) – financial payments to people.","The surprise move ends Dorsey’s much criticized tenure as chief executive officer of both Twitter and Square, his digital payments company, which led to Twitter stakeholders Elliott Management and billionaire investor Paul Singer calling on him to step down from one of those roles.

39,39,"Thea-Mai Baumann’s Instagram profile is an eclectic mix of pink-lipped selfies, David Bowie memes, colorful recordings of her hologram artwork, shots of skyscrapers in Shanghai and portraits of friends tinted in Valencia, Amaro and Toaster, all filters from Instagram’s early days. Baumann’s account, which operates under the handle @metaverse, features 10 years of her life and work. All that became inaccessible to her when she suddenly found herself disabled from her account on 2 November, days after Facebook, which owns Instagram, changed its umbrella corporate name to Meta. A message flashed on her screen: “Your account has been blocked for pretending to be someone else.” As Facebook’s corporate name change attempts to reflect the virtual world that the tech company considers the future of the internet, Baumann found herself suddenly excluded from it. “I guess I was pretty surprised but I kind of had a feeling something was going to go down,” the Sydney-based artist and technologist told the Guardian in a phone interview. “A couple of days before my account was disabled, I was getting a lot of people reaching out to me, asking to buy my handle and also other people saying that they wanted my account,” she said. Baumann did what she thought would protect her ownership over her Instagram handle. Days before her account was disabled, she minted an NFT of the first picture that she took under her @metaverse handle, an image of a fake flamingo inspecting a plant. “I just had a feeling that the @metaverse digital real estate was going to become quite pervasive in the media landscape,” Baumann said, adding, “I wanted to create a digital record of my account and prove my ownership over that @metaverse handle.” Instagram still disabled her account. In the following weeks, Baumann tried to get her account reinstated, contacting Instagram’s help center to no avail. When she finally reached out to the New York Times, which contacted Meta on 2 December asking why her account had been shut down, Baumann received a response. An Instagram spokesperson said the account had been “incorrectly removed for impersonation” and would be restored, which it was, two days later. “We’re sorry this error occurred,” the company added. “I feel like if I hadn’t reached out to the media … I think I probably would have been forgotten in the whole process, just completely ignored. I would have disappeared. I would have disappeared in the whole metaverse, Meta rebrand,” said Baumann. Baumann’s experience reflects growing concerns from artists who worry about becoming left out as tech companies such as Meta pave the way towards the metaverse, a still mostly hypothetical virtual world accessed by virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technology. “I kind of feel like the metaverse is a pretty exciting concept. I mean, we’re kind of entering this web 3.0 space or the next evolution of the internet. And unfortunately from my perspective, artists and women aren’t really centered in that design process and that engineering process,” said Baumann. “In fact, we’re … deeply marginalized and often co-opted and not part of the whole creation process of web 3.0 or the metaverse,” she added. “I didn’t want to have my work in that space erased by big tech.” Over the years, Baumann has created several brands under the @metaverse handle. “I use it as part of many creative entities that I’ve founded, so I feel like I have ownership over that handle in that social media space, the tech ecosystem and in the metaverse.” One of Baumann’s brands is an augmented reality company called Metaverse Makeovers. According to its website, which describes wearable “appcessories”, the company’s Metaverse Nails “is the only product in the world that allows you to adorn your digital and physical self with customisable holograms. It’s glam wearable tech.” To Baumann, one step towards metaverse inclusivity is for tech firms to invest in artists, “not just creating the platforms, but actually investing … and collaborating with artists to design the new infrastructure around web 3.0 and the metaverse.” Baumann plans to integrate the whole Instagram saga into P∞st_Lyfe, an art project that she started last year which is about the death of one’s digital identity in the metaverse. “Ironically, in this kind of meta moment, I experienced my own kind of digital extinguishing,” Baumann said. “It’s kind of a little bit of a weird meta experience,” she added after a pause.","A message flashed on her screen: “Your account has been blocked for pretending to be someone else.” As Facebook’s corporate name change attempts to reflect the virtual world that the tech company considers the future of the internet, Baumann found herself suddenly excluded from it. “I just had a feeling that the @metaverse digital real estate was going to become quite pervasive in the media landscape,” Baumann said, adding, “I wanted to create a digital record of my account and prove my ownership over that @metaverse handle.” Instagram still disabled her account. “I use it as part of many creative entities that I’ve founded, so I feel like I have ownership over that handle in that social media space, the tech ecosystem and in the metaverse.” One of Baumann’s brands is an augmented reality company called Metaverse Makeovers.

40,40,"Microsoft’s category-defining Windows 11 tablet finally gets the design and feature upgrade Surface Pro fans have been clamouring for, but it comes with the sting of price hike. The Surface Pro 8 starts at £999 ($999/A$1,649), without the essential £160 ($160/A$260) keyboard, which is £100 more for the tablet and £35 more for the keyboard than last year’s equivalent models. It’s the biggest upgrade since 2014: the design has been revamped to match the more modern-looking Surface Pro X, with rounded corners, slimmer bezels and a switch from magnesium to aluminium for the body. It is 116g heavier and 0.8mm thicker than the last model but looks and feels great. At 13in on the diagonal, the screen is bigger than the 12.3in of its predecessors. It is still compact compared with a laptop, but the larger screen makes working with multiple windows a bit easier. The display supports a faster refresh rate of up to 120Hz too, which is common on smartphones, high-end tablets and found on Apple’s latest MacBook Pro. Disappointingly the 120Hz screen is a feature yet to be fully realised. The Pro 8 is waiting on a firmware update due next year to enable variable refresh rates, which allows the screen to automatically adjust its speed depending on the content on display, saving battery for static images while being super smooth for fast moving animations. For now it is set to 60Hz by default to save battery life. Specifications Screen: 13in LCD 2880x1920 (267 PPI) 120Hz Processor: Intel Core i5 or i7 (11th generation) RAM: 8, 16 or 32GB Storage: 128, 256, 512GB or 1TB Graphics: Intel Iris Xe Operating system: Windows 11 Home Camera: 10MP rear, 5MP front with Windows Hello Connectivity: Wifi 6, Bluetooth 5.1, 2x Thunderbolt 4/USB-4, headphones, Surface Connect Dimensions: 287 x 208x 9.3 mm Weight: 891g (without keyboard) Faster and quieter The Pro 8 ships with new 11th-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 chips (as tested), which are 10%-15% faster than previous models in benchmarks and matched the performance of the Surface Laptop 4. A cooling system upgrade keeps the machine silent for most of the time, requiring the fans a lot less frequently than previous versions, which was a very welcome change. Microsoft has finally adopted Thunderbolt connectivity too, kitting out the Pro 8 with two USB/Thunderbolt 4 ports, which is a big, modern upgrade for connecting to displays, high-speed drives and docks, as well as charging. However, the useful microSD card slot and USB-A socket of previous models have been removed. Battery life remains very similar to previous models with only about seven hours of work between charges, which is less than half the 16 hours of the market-leading MacBook Air. Sustainability Microsoft does not provide an expected lifespan for the Pro 8’s battery; those in similar devices typically maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for in excess of 500 full charge cycles. The tablet is generally repairable with an out-of-warranty service fee of £424.02 and a battery replacement fee of £280.44. The tablet contains no recycled materials, but Microsoft operates recycling schemes for old machines, publishes a company-wide sustainability report and a breakdown of each product’s environmental impact. Windows 11 The Pro 8 runs the new Windows 11, which is the same as the Go 3 tablet, but is much snappier because of the faster chips. Windows 11 is a better fit for a tablet, with a more touch-friendly interface and significantly improved touchscreen keyboard. Windows 11 is still a little rough around the edges but is improving rapidly. Those transitioning from Windows 10 will find it mostly works the same with a few design changes such as the central Start menu. Signature keyboard and Slim Pen 2 The Pro 8 tablet is only half the equation. It supports Microsoft’s updated Signature detachable keyboard, which is stiffer and flexes less when you type than its predecessor. The keys and trackpad are still great. The new Slim Pen 2 stylus has a small vibrating motor in it, which activates when you drag the it across the screen to provide the sensation of pen-on-paper. It won’t miraculously give you artistic talent, but it really adds to the experience of drawing or writing on glass. Some apps can make the pen feel like it is clicking, too, when you activate certain functions or menus. The Slim Pen 2’s haptics only work in apps that support it, such as Microsoft’s Word, Journal, Whiteboard and PowerPoint, Adobe Fresco and a small handful of others so far. Observations The speakers are decent and can get quite loud, but lack bass. The screen is very reflective, which could make using it outdoors in direct light a challenge. Price The Microsoft Surface Pro 8 starts at £999 ($999/A$1,649) with an Intel Core i5, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and is available in various different memory and storage combinations. Versions with the Core i7 chip start at £1,499 ($1,599/A$2,399). The Signature keyboard costs £159.99 ($159.99/A$259.95) on its own or £259.99 ($279.99/A$429.95) with the Slim Pen 2. For comparison, the Surface Laptop 4 starts at £799, the Surface Go 2 costs £369, the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 costs £1,199, the Apple iPad Pro 12.9in costs £999, the MacBook Air costs £999 and the MacBook Pro costs £1,899. Verdict The Surface Pro 8 is Microsoft’s best tablet PC yet, finally adding some much-needed modern upgrades to an already winning formula. The more rounded, sleeker design feels great. The larger, better screen with smaller bezels helps productivity. It has the latest Intel chips, runs much quieter and finally has Thunderbolt connectivity for docks, drives, displays and much more. Battery life is just about good enough for a day of work, but miles behind market leaders. The 120Hz display will be a great feature once it is fully realised with an update. The removal of the microSD card slot is slightly disappointing, but the modular SSD is very welcome. The real starting cost of £1,160 with keyboard is slightly more than the equivalent standard laptop. If you want a compact and adaptable Windows 11 machine that can turn from a solid laptop replacement to a creative tablet in an instant, the Surface Pro 8 is unrivalled. Pros: great screen, good performance, Thunderbolt4/USB-4, excellent keyboard (essential additional purchase), excellent kickstand, Windows Hello, solid build, great stylus (optional purchase), removable SSD. Cons: fairly expensive, keyboard should be included, no USB-A port, no microSD card slot, waiting for an update to enable the variable refresh rate of the screen.

41,41,"In May Chloe Roberson of Chattanooga, Tennessee, injured her knee while working her shift at Amazon and she has been out of work since, while fighting with the company for workers’ compensation and paid medical leave. Roberson, 21, chose to go to the emergency room rather than Amazon’s on-site medical clinic, Amcare, and was referred to a sports medicine doctor who diagnosed her with a dislocated patella (kneecap). Her initial recovery was 10 weeks of physical therapy followed by a steroid shot, but she was later scheduled for surgery on 28 October to repair her knee. “While all of this is going on, I’ve been having to fight Amazon for time off and money,” said Roberson. “They refused workers’ compensation, as I had a dislocated patella when I was 14 years old. I’m 21 now so I don’t see how it’s related.” Roberson and her wife have struggled to cover bills while recovering from her injury and battling Amazon. “I have not had a single day that I haven’t been an absolute sobbing mess because of the stress Amazon continues to put me through,” added Roberson. Reports of high injury rates and high turnover rates at Amazon warehouses around the US as a result of immense productivity pressures and quota rates on workers have been documented by numerous media outlets and organizations over the past several years and confirmed by OSHA logs. Amazon shareholders have recently called for an independent safety audit of the company. A May 2021 report published by the Strategic Organizing Center found Amazon’s injury rates were double the injury rate in the warehousing industry and 80% higher than the industry average for serious injuries in 2020. Jerald Crowley worked at an Amazon distribution center in Greenville, South Carolina, for six months before he resigned on 3 November due to a wrist injury he sustained on the job, as he is deaf and couldn’t afford to lose use of his hand to communicate in sign language with his children. His rate for stacking boxes on pallets was 40 boxes an hour, and he cited the rate as the reason for his injury. “I suffered a high sprain on my right wrist when I was attempting to bring a box in the back of the pallet,” Crowley said. “Their safety rules are that I’m supposed to report it and they will bring it down, but their rate is 40 boxes an hour. I was trying to get credit for the box – if I did not, they could let me go simply because I did not meet the rates, so safety was basically out the window when they chose rates over safety.” On 1 January 2021, the state of Washington increased workers compensation premiums for Amazon due to higher injury rates at Amazon warehouses compared with other warehouses in the state. In December 2021, the National Employment Law Project released a report on injury rates at Amazon’s six warehouses in Minnesota, revealing those facilities have injury rates twice as high as rates for other warehouses in the state, and more than four times the average for all industries in the state. An Amazon spokesperson said in response to the report: “While we know we’re not perfect, this report ignores the perspectives of the vast majority of our employees in Minnesota, who tell us that they’re proud to work at Amazon and feel supported in their roles.” Mustafa Omar started working at Amazon in 2016, but left in 2017 and returned in 2018, and has worked there for the past three years. He picks and loads items that weigh up to 80lbs, typically working on six or seven different stations. He has experienced back pain due to the repetitive motions and lifting heavy items involved in his job. In early November 2021, Omar fell back onto a pallet, injuring his back. He flagged down a senior manager to get his station covered so he could go to Amcare. Omar said he felt like he was in trouble when he asked the manager to take him to the clinic, where he was given ice and ibuprofen. “At this time, I’m thinking ‘oh my God, if I say that I have an injury, that I’ve hurt myself, I might lose my job.’ Because they already instilled fear in me about me being the one that was getting in trouble. I’m thinking about my family, my pregnant wife, my kids, about all the bills that I have and worrying about not being able to work because I’m the breadwinner in my house,” said Omar. Once at Amcare, he downplayed the pain he was feeling so he would be sent back to work, and continued working for a few weeks while visiting Amcare about twice a day for ice and ibuprofen. Eventually he couldn’t tolerate the pain any longer and visited his own doctor, who recommended physical therapy, pain medication and light duty accommodations. When he brought his doctor’s forms to Amazon, Omar says he was told he couldn’t attend the recommended physical therapy because it wasn’t approved. He is still waiting to hear back about getting medical treatment approved by Amazon and his workers’ compensation claim approved and paid out. “I’m still in pain today,” Omar added. “All of us want to come home safely, and when people get injured they should be treated like human beings and taken care of.” Irene Tung, senior researcher and policy analyst at NELP, and Debbie Berkowitz, worker health and safety director at NELP, coauthors of the report, explained Amazon’s high injury rates are a result of rapid work paces, surveillance and disciplinary systems. They added that workers have to operate under constantly changing rules and metrics, regulatory agencies are underfunded, and worker protections are inadequate. “None of these measures that Amazon have taken have really got to the core of the problem, which is the excessively rapid work pace and how it’s enforced through their very distinctive disciplinary system that combines intensive electronic surveillance with very frequent discipline and termination. They have not addressed that and that is the fundamental driver of these injuries,” said Tung. Berkowitz added Amazon’s time-off task disciplinary technology cultivates a climate of fear among workers and drives them to push their bodies in a way that creates high rates of injuries. “Workers are measured by the second and they’re punished by the second,” said Berkowitz. “It basically creates an environment where if they’re not constantly moving, then they might be fired.” Several workers who spoke with the Guardian described delays and other obstacles in applying for workers compensation or receiving medical treatment after sustaining an injury on the job at Amazon. Natalie Monarrez, age 52, has worked as a ship dock worker at Amazon in Staten Island, New York, for about four years. During the pandemic, she lived in her car outside the Amazon warehouse while working a lot of overtime – 12-hour shifts, five to six days a week – as many workers took unpaid leaves in the first few months of the pandemic. Monarrez said several months into the pandemic, the grueling nature of her job and long hours began taking their toll on her body. “Swelling in my left ankle had just reached a point where I couldn’t even fit it in a shoe. I had trouble walking. I had trouble standing,” said Monarrez. “As my job is sorting, I have to stand in the same spot for my entire shift. We’re not allowed to sit down and I was lifting heavy packages the entire time and rotating the upper half of my body. But I couldn’t take it anymore and I knew that it was because of work.” She filed a workers’ compensation claim in August 2020, though she said she received pushback from managers while trying to file the claim until she took off her shoe, showed them her ankle, and insisted on filing the claim and being sent to an Amazon-approved doctor. Once she filed the claim, Monarrez said she has experienced several problems in contacting Amazon’s workers’ compensation insurer, Sedgwick, to correct her pay above the weekly minimum and getting medical treatments and a medical boot for her ankle approved. She took a couple months off work, but returned to work because the compensation she was receiving, about $400 a week, was much lower than her usual weekly paychecks. “At this point, I went to Walmart and Target and I literally bought my own braces for my ankle and my foot, and I elevate my foot every night after work,” said Monarrez. “I never had health issues before working for Amazon.” Amazon did not comment on complaints about workers’ compensation and deferred to a blog post by CEO Dave Clark on time-off task surveillance and disciplinary systems. In regards to injury rates, a spokesperson for Amazon said in an email: “The safety and well-being of our employees is always a top priority. We recognize that helping employees stay safe in physical roles takes a lot of focus and investment, which is why we’re investing hundreds of millions in safety in many different ways, from people – we now have a team of nearly 8,000 dedicated safety professionals – to training, to tools and technology.”","I was trying to get credit for the box – if I did not, they could let me go simply because I did not meet the rates, so safety was basically out the window when they chose rates over safety.” On 1 January 2021, the state of Washington increased workers compensation premiums for Amazon due to higher injury rates at Amazon warehouses compared with other warehouses in the state.

42,42,"Elizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos, has been found guilty on four of 11 charges of fraud, concluding a high-profile trial that captivated Silicon Valley and chronicled the missteps of the now-defunct blood testing startup. The jury found Holmes guilty of several charges – including conspiracy to defraud investors – following a dramatic day in which jurors said they remained deadlocked on three of the criminal counts she faced. On Monday, the seventh day of deliberations, the jury told US district judge Edward Davila that it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on those three charges. In response, Davila encouraged them to deliberate further, but jurors later returned and rendered their final decision. As the verdict was read, the Theranos founder bowed her head, remained seated and expressed no visible emotion. Her partner, Billy Evans, showed agitation in earlier moments but appeared calm during the verdict reading. Holmes was found guilty on four charges: one count of conspiracy to defraud investors, and three counts of wire fraud against investors. Holmes was meanwhile acquitted on three charges, including one conspiracy to defraud patients and two charges related to patients who received inaccurate test results. One charge was thrown out earlier in the trial, and the jury did not come to a verdict on the remaining three charges. The verdict seals Holmes’ extraordinary rise and fall and could have wide-ranging consequences for the tech industry. It also marked an indictment of the hype machine that helped rocket Holmes to fame, as she graced the covers of major magazines, headlined conferences, and drew comparisons to Apple’s Steve Jobs. The split verdicts are “a mixed bag for the prosecution, but it’s a loss for Elizabeth Holmes because she is going away to prison for at least a few years”, said David Ring, a lawyer who has been following the Holmes case closely. Holmes, 37, faces prison time, although a sentencing date has not been set. She pleaded not guilty and is expected to appeal. After the judge left the courtroom to meet with jurors individually, Holmes got up to hug her partner Billy Evans and her parents before leaving with her lawyers. Over the course of nearly four months, federal prosecutors called 29 witnesses, outlining missteps and alleged fraud Holmes committed during her 15-year reign as CEO. Holmes founded the company after dropping out of Stanford at 19 years old, promising a revolutionary technology that could run hundreds of health tests on just a drop of blood. But the company ultimately fell short of its ambitious pledge. Once a charismatic figure, Holmes was initially hailed as a visionary. As Theranos grew, the company attracted big-name investors including the former secretaries of state George Shultz and Henry Kissinger. At its height, Theranos was valued at more than $9bn. But cracks in the glossy surface began to show in 2015 when Wall Street Journal reporting revealed that its in-house tests had massive inaccuracies, and that the company was performing other tests using traditional blood drawing methodology and outside labs. The fall of Theranos has been followed with perhaps even more fervor than its spectacular rise, inspiring multiple documentaries, a feature film, and an upcoming television show. Starting in late August, throngs of reporters have lined up in the early morning hours for a seat inside the federal court house in San Jose, California. During the trial, prosecutors painted a picture of Holmes as a strict, power-hungry leader willing to go to any lengths to save her company’s image, repressing internal and external dissent and manipulating the press. “She chose fraud over business failure,” prosecutor Jeff Schenk said in his closing arguments. “She choose to be dishonest with investors and patients. That choice was not only callous, it was criminal.” As witnesses, the prosecution called forward Theranos lab directors who testified that their concerns over the technology’s shortcomings were largely ignored. Meanwhile, investors such as the former US secretary of defense James Mattis said he and others were discouraged from scrutinizing the company for fear of missing out on opportunities. The defense team for Holmes sought to counter that image by portraying Holmes as an ambitious entrepreneur who did not knowingly commit fraud, but rather did not understand the shortcomings of Theranos’ complex technology. Those arguments came to a head when Holmes made the stunning decision to take the stand in her own defense, arguing she made decisions in good faith and did not knowingly commit fraud. Prosecutors repeatedly pointed to documents that Holmes admitted to doctoring before sharing with potential partners, adding the logos of pharmaceutical firms and falsely implying they had endorsed the methodology. “I wish I hadn’t done that,” she told the jury on the stand. Her defense team stated in closing arguments that the logo evidence was “a distraction” and that Holmes was in talks with those companies at the time. Her attorneys also put forward a line of defense that Holmes was abused by her former romantic and business partner Sunny Balwani, who served for ten years as co-president of the company. “There was another side of Holmes’s relationship with Balwani that the public never saw,” said defense attorney Lance Wade in opening arguments, adding that “trusting [Balwani] as her primary adviser was one of her mistakes”. Some of the most powerful moments in the trial came when Holmes testified directly about Balwani’s alleged abuse, growing emotional as the prosecution called on her to read their romantic texts. She claimed he controlled what she did, who she spent time with, and even what she ate in an effort to turn her into a successful CEO. Balwani has strongly denied claims of mistreating Holmes. He faces his own trial in 2022 for fraud. Holmes did not respond to questions lobbed at her during a walk from the courthouse to the nearby hotel on Monday where she has stayed during jury deliberations. In a written statement, the US attorney Stephanie Hinds thanked the jury for navigating the case through the pandemic and said Holmes must now be held “culpable” for her crimes. Holmes will remain free on bond while awaiting sentencing, which will be determined by the judge.

Here are some of the highlights. The NFT television The non fungible token, which confers ownership of a unique digital item such as a work of art, became a multi-billion dollar market in 2021 and Samsung announced a new TV feature that allows enthusiasts to browse, display and buy NFT-based art. Given how much some NFTs cost, you may not have much left over to pay for the screen. The stress-forecasting timepiece Nowatch has produced a smartwatch that monitors your cortisol levels to predict stress. Developed with the electronics firm Philips, the watch predicts if you are about to become stressed an hour in advance and recommends activities to avoid that, such as going for a walk or meditating. The health-monitoring lightbulb Running out of interconnected home products? A lightbulb that tracks your body temperature and heart rate using a combination of radar technology and artificial intelligence was unveiled by Sengled, the Shanghai-based maker of smart bulbs. The bulb connects to a smartphone app and its colours change if it detects anything amiss. Sengled says its Smart Health Monitoring Light can even detect falls. The portable burglar detector Germany’s Bosch presented the Spexor, an 11.9cm-high (4.7in) device that monitors air pressure, noise and motion to detect break-ins. It can also measure air quality and temperature.

44,44,"Before moving overseas six years ago, I sold my car and have been living without one ever since. Life in New York for the first two years was a breeze, but being car-free in Sydney? Not so much. Private cars have always been integral to getting from A to B in Australia. While I caught the bus to school, afternoon and weekend activities usually required a lift from my parents or those of a friend. I got my own licence as soon as I was eligible and a few years later bought my first car, which I used most days. The past four years have felt like a struggle against the inertia of an environment built for cars – especially now that I’m carless in a beachside suburb with no train station and only a couple of bus services. I have lucked upon a single bus that takes me door-to-office in about 30 minutes, making travelling to work via public transport a simple choice. But travelling 5km across a couple of suburbs to visit a bar or restaurant isn’t as easy. In one example it requires a minimum of two buses and a 40-minute journey, or 53 minutes on foot, according to Google maps. Driving would take just 13 minutes. Before giving in and buying a car, I decided to spend 12 months using the car-sharing app GoGet, taking stock of the costs and experience in an effort to avoid the significant outlay and carbon emissions a personal car entails. In that time I learned that car-sharing is both liberating and a big hassle. Lesson 1: it wasn’t cheaper (for me) to share GoGet offers a network of 3,400 vehicles spread across five Australian cities that you can rent through an app for an hourly rate, and access via a smart card. There are starter, occasional or frequent plans, depending on your usage. I paid $30 a month for a minimum hire rate of $6.70 per hour, plus $0.40 per kilometre, which included petrol and insurance. The app shows you a map of nearby vehicles that you can book in advance, and cancel right up until the last minute. With several cars located within 500m of my apartment, including an SUV with a baby seat, I only once had an issue finding a conveniently located free car. Over the course of 12 months I took 80 trips, travelled 1,690km and spent $2,246.15 on GoGet – an average of $187 a month. I used a friend’s car to calculate the rough equivalent cost of a private car, which came in slightly higher at $2,406 ($477 for mandatory “green slip” liability insurance, $381 for registration, $1,248 for optional comprehensive car insurance and $300 on petrol). At face value, these costs are similar, but there are some qualifications. For the first six months of the year, I had a friend living around the corner whose car I borrowed at least once a week for small trips. I also sometimes found it was cheaper to pay for an Uber than to pay for time the GoGet car would spend parked near the venue (you can extend the booking in 30-minute intervals). And, crucially, this experiment took place during the pandemic, with at least a quarter of that time spent in lockdown. In normal times, which I hope are coming, I would expect to drive more often, and further afield – particularly to see my parents who live 27km away (50 minutes by car, more than twice that via public transport, or $60 via GoGet for a three-hour visit). Lesson 2: it made me more environmentally aware Using a car-sharing service made me more aware of both my spending on transport and my environmental footprint. Every time I went to book, I would ask: “Do you really need a car for this? Do you really need to make this trip?” – something I never did when I had my own car. Usually the answer was yes, but that didn’t assuage the nagging sense of guilt I felt knowing I was contributing to CO2 in the atmosphere and spending money I could ostensibly be saving. I suspect the guilt I felt booking cars was more financial than environmental, but I did become more aware of my carbon footprint in the process, and it has become more of a factor in my decision on whether to buy again. Lesson 3: parking is (a bit) easier Since I’m near the coast, parking in my area tends to become tricky on sunny days. Jennifer Kent, a senior research fellow in urbanism at the University of Sydney, says lack of access to parking is “a huge motivator” for car sharing. “People are moving into inner city areas where parking is extremely constrained and they’ve simply got nowhere to put a car. But you’ve got to put that in the context that to be able to [give up having their own car] they need to have access to good public transport, good walking and good cycling for all the other trips that make up their lives. “Car-sharing is not for regular journeys, it’s too expensive, so car-sharing only works as part of that network. And that’s half the problem we’re facing with getting car-sharing to work out in the suburbs.” In my case, GoGet only somewhat alleviated this problem, with its own reserved parking, since I would often find a Porsche or similar luxury car taking up the spot on my return anyway. Lesson 4: Australians aren’t used to sharing Kent says Australian cities “kind of grew up at the time of the private car”. “We just assumed that everybody would have access to a car, so that’s how we planned our suburbs. They’re really low density, they’re really difficult to retrofit with public transport, the distances that people travel are fairly long, so very difficult to satisfy with walking and cycling – and it’s very hard to change that around once it’s been established.” As a result, Australians are used to the independence a private car provides: the ability to go where we want, whenever we want, to carry a load, the feeling of safety a car provides – and also the sense of privacy. And we’re unwilling to give this up. “Australians are not typically all that great at sharing stuff,” Kent says. “If you think about the great Aussie dream, it’s all about private spaces, private backyards ... and that extends to cars … A lot of people actually see [their] car as an extension of their living room. You hear stories about people storing heaps of stuff in their car, a change of clothes etc. We can’t make that jump towards sharing because it’s not only that we’re sharing the mobility of the car, we’re also giving up that sense of space.” At times during the past year, for a week here and there, I had access to the cars of friends or family who were travelling, and I definitely noticed the extra convenience of knowing the car was there whenever I needed it. That convenience isn’t a deciding factor in whether to buy a car, but it’s certainly a nice-to-have at times. On the other hand, I also enjoy the feeling of being part of a sharing culture, it feels more communal and is something I miss about the New York subway, for instance. Lesson 5: we can’t go on like this One of the main outcomes of this experiment has been to make me more aware that my decisions are primarily based on self-interest. I’m not alone. “We’re more of an individualistic society than societies in Europe, for example, where car-sharing is a bit more popular,” Kent says. “We have this understanding that in society there is inequality, and we’re OK with that inequality existing. Whereas other countries where sharing might be more popular see more of a defence of a more equal society, and more equal access, which is better suited to things like public transport, and car sharing.” Kent says Australia’s attachment to private cars is a vicious circle. In order to give up our cars, we need to know that the public transport infrastructure exists for us to get where we need to go in a timely manner. But for public transport to improve, there needs to be a strong constituency voting for it in the first place. Without that, she says, a stick might help. “I think we actually need for things to get a little bit dire. So looking at the snapback, post-Covid, for example, all the modelling suggests that traffic is going to increase … because people are not wanting to use public transport. And the only thing that’s going to stop that from happening is increased congestion – people just getting sick of being stuck in traffic and shrugging their shoulders and saying, ‘OK, I’ll get back on the bus’. “We’re a bit like surly teenagers, you know? Like, if you make me I’ll do it, but I’ll do it begrudgingly.” I still haven’t decided whether to buy a car, but I’m leaning in that direction. While this experience has made me reflect on the role of private cars in our society and think deeply about what kind of city I want to live in, I suspect the practical need to keep travel time and costs down will tip the scales in favour of ownership in the long run.","Before giving in and buying a car, I decided to spend 12 months using the car-sharing app GoGet, taking stock of the costs and experience in an effort to avoid the significant outlay and carbon emissions a personal car entails. They’re really low density, they’re really difficult to retrofit with public transport, the distances that people travel are fairly long, so very difficult to satisfy with walking and cycling – and it’s very hard to change that around once it’s been established.” As a result, Australians are used to the independence a private car provides: the ability to go where we want, whenever we want, to carry a load, the feeling of safety a car provides – and also the sense of privacy. We can’t make that jump towards sharing because it’s not only that we’re sharing the mobility of the car, we’re also giving up that sense of space.” At times during the past year, for a week here and there, I had access to the cars of friends or family who were travelling, and I definitely noticed the extra convenience of knowing the car was there whenever I needed it. While this experience has made me reflect on the role of private cars in our society and think deeply about what kind of city I want to live in, I suspect the practical need to keep travel time and costs down will tip the scales in favour of ownership in the long run. ","Lesson 4: Australians aren’t used to sharing Kent says Australian cities “kind of grew up at the time of the private car”. “We just assumed that everybody would have access to a car, so that’s how we planned our suburbs. They’re really low density, they’re really difficult to retrofit with public transport, the distances that people travel are fairly long, so very difficult to satisfy with walking and cycling – and it’s very hard to change that around once it’s been established.” As a result, Australians are used to the independence a private car provides: the ability to go where we want, whenever we want, to carry a load, the feeling of safety a car provides – and also the sense of privacy. Whereas other countries where sharing might be more popular see more of a defence of a more equal society, and more equal access, which is better suited to things like public transport, and car sharing.” Kent says Australia’s attachment to private cars is a vicious circle.

45,45,"Cryptocurrency firms bombarded Londoners with a record number of adverts on public transport during 2021, fuelling calls for a ban to prevent people being lured into risky investments. The surge in adverts for crypto assets, which are unregulated in the UK, has prompted concerns about the risk of addiction and financial harm, particularly given the wild volatility in the price of digital currencies such as bitcoin, which reached record highs last year before crashing again. It also emerged that Transport for London (TfL) has not implemented a ban on gambling adverts promised by the mayor, Sadiq Khan, allowing the industry to step up its marketing activity in the meantime. Records obtained by the Guardian under the Freedom of Information Act show that TfL services displayed 39,560 crypto adverts from 13 firms in the six months between April and September 2021. Major advertisers include the trading platform eToro, floki – “a “meme coin” named after Elon Musk’s dog – Crypto.com and Luno Money, whose campaign telling people it was “time to buy” bitcoin was banned by the advertising regulator for being “irresponsible”. The promotional drive eclipsed previous years, as advertisers tapped into the popularity of smartphone trading apps and increased awareness of digital currencies such as bitcoin and ether. In 2019, the only advertiser offering crypto services on TfL buses and trains was trading platform eToro, which paid for just five digital displays and 40 “supersides”, long posters on the side of doubledecker buses. Despite widespread working from home in 2020, the volume of crypto ads increased, with companies including Luno Money and Coinfloor buying 1,595 ads between them. Before the recent surge, 2018 was the busiest year for crypto ads on TfL since it started recording data in 2017. Even then, 15,000 were shown in 12 months, compared with 39,560 after just six months of 2021, including promotions for relatively obscure firms such as Hex, Kraken, BOTS, and Puglife. In total, crypto companies have spent £825,245 to advertise on TfL tube and train services since 2018. The organisation does not hold spending data for buses. A separate freedom of information request by the Guardian revealed that the crypto advertising push was mirrored by a significant increase in gambling ads, as Khan’s April 2021 promise to ban gambling ads appeared to stall. In 2018-19, online casinos and bookmakers spent £783,476 to advertise on TfL services, then £1m the following year, followed by £1.16m in 2020-21. But they spent £1.17m in the first three months of the 2021-22 period. While the Euros football championship likely to have fuelled the increase in part, spending was nearly six times higher than in 2018, the year of the last World Cup. Khan pledged to ban gambling ads in his manifesto, published nearly nine months ago, but a spokesperson for the Mayor’s office said it was yet to be enacted. Siân Berry, the Green party’s former co-leader, now its London Assembly member, urged Khan to move forward with the ban and extend it to crypto adverts. “Investment bubbles have always worked by dragging in more and more inexperienced suckers towards the end of the cycle. That’s the stage at which some of these projects may be at with all this public advertising,” she said. “The risk is that they draw in people who are more likely than not to lose money, which is closely equivalent to gambling and I think these promotions should be banned by Transport for London in the same way.” “People are struggling at the moment and they may have had blows to their life chances. They may have lost livelihoods or homes and be susceptible to get-rich-quick schemes.” “Are TfL doing proper checks to establish whether these are legitimate companies?” A TfL spokesperson said all adverts contained a disclaimer stating that crypto is unregulated in the UK and that the value of investments could fall. The transport body is vetting ads before they run and is understood to be refusing any that use similar language to those that have been banned or investigated by the ASA. It has written to both the FCA and ASA seeking further guidance. The managing director of eToro UK, Dan Moczulski, said: “eToro fully supports measures, including regulation, designed to protect and educate investors about crypto and other financial asset classes.” Asked about the concerns raised about their advertising, several of the crypto firms responded, saying any dangers were well flagged and not unique to crypto assets. Floki, one of whose adverts is being investigated by the ASA, said banning crypto ads would be “censorship” and that ads should be regulated and include disclaimers. It also said crypto was “anything but a bubble” and would “change the world as we know it”. Kraken said bubbles “generally don’t last over a decade” with a high degree of adoption by institutions. BOTS said all investments came with risk and pointed out that the financial crisis of 2008 showed traditional finance wasn’t without dangers. Luno Money, whose bitcoin advert was banned by the ASA last year, said it would welcome “more formal guidance”, which it hoped would emerge this year.","The surge in adverts for crypto assets, which are unregulated in the UK, has prompted concerns about the risk of addiction and financial harm, particularly given the wild volatility in the price of digital currencies such as bitcoin, which reached record highs last year before crashing again. “The risk is that they draw in people who are more likely than not to lose money, which is closely equivalent to gambling and I think these promotions should be banned by Transport for London in the same way.” “People are struggling at the moment and they may have had blows to their life chances.

46,46,"Millions of people’s credit cards will stop working on Amazon’s UK website from this week – unless there is an 11th-hour resolution to a bitter dispute between the retailer and payments giant Visa. In November, Amazon told customers that from 19 January it would stop accepting payments made with UK-issued Visa credit cards, in what has been described as a “game of corporate chicken”. It is not known how many people are affected by the payment ban, though in March 2021, Mintel said 89% of Britons shopped at Amazon, and its analysts estimated Amazon Prime membership in the UK at about 21 million. Last month it was claimed that Amazon faces losing nearly £1.4bn from UK shoppers as a result of its move. There is speculation, however, that a last-minute agreement could be reached between the two sides. On Friday, Amazon and Visa declined to provide an update on negotiations. Amazon blamed its decision on “the high fees Visa charges for processing credit card transactions”. The move potentially inconveniences millions of people who use a Visa credit card issued by providers including Barclaycard to buy items on the website or pay for their Amazon Prime membership. The retailer said it would continue to accept all debit cards (including Visa debit cards) and non-Visa credit cards, including Mastercard-branded ones and American Express. Affected customers who currently use a Visa credit card have been told they need to update their payment method, otherwise any new orders they place on the site will be rejected from 19 January onwards. They will also lose access to Amazon Prime benefits including faster delivery of items, thousands of TV shows and films on Prime Video, and the Amazon Music Prime streaming service. At the time of the announcement, Visa said it was “continuing to work toward a resolution,” while Martin Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said he suspected the move was a possible negotiating tactic by Amazon to get Visa to lower its fees. To date there has been no news of any agreement, and on Thursday, a blog in trade journal the Grocer said this was a “game of corporate chicken” – a row where neither side wants to be the first to back down. Nevertheless, one credit card industry insider told the Guardian: “We are hopeful there will be an agreement.” In emails to customers, Amazon has acknowledged that removing the ability to pay for products with a Visa credit card and making people update their details may be inconvenient and “a bit of a bother”. Payments on cards attract a range of fees including interchange fees, which are paid by businesses to card issuers each time a card is used by a consumer, and are higher for credit card transactions. Card fees have long been an issue of contention between providers and retailers, and last week MPs waded into the row. The Commons Treasury select committee said that in October, a few weeks before Amazon’s announcement, both Mastercard and Visa hiked cross-border interchange fees for debit and credit card transactions, from 0.2% to 0.3% and from 1.15% to 1.5% respectively. It added that the fees paid by businesses to card payment operators for use of the service had also risen substantially. Visa said in November that it was “very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future”. Many shoppers choose to use credit cards for large purchases online because of the extra protections offered if things go wrong. Amazon’s decision also deals a blow to people who use their Visa credit card to spread the cost of their spending, or to collect points, air miles or cashback.","At the time of the announcement, Visa said it was “continuing to work toward a resolution,” while Martin Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said he suspected the move was a possible negotiating tactic by Amazon to get Visa to lower its fees.

48,48,"Amazon has confirmed its Alexa virtual assistant service suffered an outage in the UK and mainland Europe but is now back to normal. The Downdetector website reported a wave of Alexa outages in the UK and across Europe on Friday morning at about 7am GMT, with the reports spread throughout the UK. An Amazon spokesperson said: “This morning we had an issue that impacted some Alexa customers’ ability to interact with the service. The Alexa service is now operating normally.” Many users said they had been left unable to wake their voice-activated Amazon Echo smart devices, with some seeing a ring of red lights and a message asking them to try again later or that “something went wrong”. Others complained on social media of being unable to use their Alexa-powered gadgets to play music or radio, access alarms and reminders, or carry out other daily tasks. According to Downdetector, the reports of outages peaked at about 8.20am and had fallen sharply by 9.30am. In December last year, several Amazon services – including its website, Prime Video and applications that use Amazon Web Services (AWS) – went down for thousands of users. At the time the e-commerce company said the outage was because of problems related to the application programming interface (API), which is a set of protocols for building and integrating application software.","Amazon has confirmed its Alexa virtual assistant service suffered an outage in the UK and mainland Europe but is now back to normal.

49,49,"Bose is back with a revamp of its most popular noise-cancelling headphones, which improve the technology but keep the good bits mostly the same. The company appears to have taken an “ain’t broke, don’t fix it” approach to the new headphones, which are similar to the excellent QuietComfort 35 from 2016 but markedly different to the more modern NCH 700 that launched two years ago. The QuietComfort 45 cost £320 ($330/A$500) and are non-showy and comfortable. The design has been refined with smoother ear cushions and fewer lines and microphone holes in the ear cups for a more minimalist look, but side by side the differences with the QuietComfort 35s are subtle. The headband is now lined with smoother vegan leather rather than the suede-like Alcantara of their predecessors. The headphones are still light, well balanced and stay put on your head without needing to clamp particularly hard, aiding their long-term comfort. The construction feels robust and capable of taking a beating, similar to their longstanding predecessors that stood up very well to years of the rough and tumble of travel and my daily commute. Controls and connectivity The QC45 are a standard set of Bluetooth 5.1 headphones supporting the universal SBC and AAC audio formats, which are compatible with most phones, tablets, computers and other devices. They can connect to two devices at once, such as a phone for calls and tablet for video, and had a rock solid connection to iPhones and Android devices. You can use a cable for wired listening even when the headphones are out of battery. A sliding switch turns the headphones on and off and puts them into pairing mode, while a trio of buttons control playback and volume. A button on the left cup switches between sound modes. Unlike most high-end rivals, the QC45 do not pause the music when you take them off, however. Specifications Weight: 240g Dimensions: 184 x 152.4 x 76.2mm Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.1 with multipoint, 3.5mm, USB-C charging Bluetooth codecs: SBC, AAC Battery life: 24 hours Sound and noise cancelling All Bose headphones have a signature sound that has proven divisive in audiophile circles, typically because they heavily process sound, which means music is considered to be removed from what the artist intended. The QC45 sound generally pleasant and better balanced than rivals, producing a solid punch in the low end without it overriding other tones. Vocals are particularly clear, but the treble and highs can be over accentuated, making some punk tracks with heavy use of cymbals a little overbearing. Separation between instruments and tones is excellent, even for very complex and overlapping tracks. Despite lacking any virtual surround-sound feature, the QC45 do an excellent job of recreating the big booms, action and vocals of movies. The active noise cancelling removes more unwanted sound than almost any other set of headphones, reducing higher tones and speech more reliably and to a greater extent than most rivals. Unlike the NCH 700, the QC45 only have two sound modes: “quiet”, with noise canceling on, and “aware”, with noise cancelling turned off and the sound of the outside world piped in – useful for listing out for traffic or announcements. You cannot use them without one or other sound mode turned on. Call quality is reasonable, with my voice coming through clear if a little distant-sounding, but they let some background noise through and fall far short of the performance of the NCH 700. Battery life The QC45 last for about 25 hours of listening over Bluetooth between charges or significantly longer via cable. That’s plenty for most commutes and the longest of flights, but five hours short of their best competitors from Sony. They fully charge via USB-C in 2.5 hours, with a 15-minute charge adding up to three hours of playback. Sustainability Bose estimates that the battery will last in excess of 500 full charge cycles but it is not replaceable, ultimately making the headphones disposable. The headphones are generally repairable, and some replacement parts including the ear cushions, at £24.95 for a pair, are available. The headphones do not contain recycled materials. Bose does not publish individual product environmental impact reports but does publish annual sustainability reports. Price The Bose QuietComfort 45 cost £319.95 ($329/A$499.95). For comparison, the RRP of the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 is £349.95, the QuietComfort 35 II cost £299.95, the QuietComfort Earbuds cost £249.95, the Sony WH-1000XM4 cost £279, B&amp;W PX7 cost £349.99, Apple AirPods Max cost £549. Verdict The Bose QuietComfort 45 offer some of the very best noise cancelling and comfort money can buy. If you need a set of headphones to wear for hours on end, such as on long-haul flights or endless commutes, there aren’t many better options. They’re light, fold up for travel, feel robust, sound good, connect to two devices at once, can be used with a cable and last for about 25 hours between charges. But while that formula made their predecessors top dog in 2016, the QC45 lack the bells and whistles offered by the latest rivals at similar or lower prices, such as automatic pause, virtual surround sound, sound and noise cancelling customisation and support for higher quality audio formats. The Bose are still great but a bit pricy at RRP. They are frequently discounted so look for a deal or consider the still excellent QC 35 II, which are available for about £200. Note the battery cannot be replaced on the new headphones by Bose, ultimately making them disposable and losing a star. Pros: best-in-class noise cancelling, super comfortable, 25-hour battery life, good sound, Bluetooth can connect to two devices at once, fold up for travel, cross-platform companion app, can be used with a cable. Cons: expensive, voice mic lets in background noise, no higher-quality audio format support, no equaliser, no variable noise cancelling levels.

50,50,"Microsoft reported a profit of $18.8bn for the last three months of 2021, ahead of analysts expectations, but its share price initially slumped over 5% after another rocky day on Wall Street. The Seattle-based software giant reported revenues of $51.7bn, an increase of 20% compared to the same period last year and ahead of expectations. But the news was not enough to impress investors who appear to have soured on the tech sector after a historic boom in share prices during the pandemic. Microsoft is the first of the biggest US tech companies to report quarterly earnings with Apple, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet to come. The reports are being closely watched after Netflix’s share price collapsed following the release of disappointing subscriber numbers. Since Netflix’s fall, stock markets have gyrated wildly. Investors are concerned about the Federal Reserve’s plans to raise interest rates and escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Microsoft’s cloud computing business benefitted from the shift online during the pandemic as Covid-19 closed down offices across the world. Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft, said he expected the trend to continue. “Digital technology is the most malleable resource at the world’s disposal to overcome constraints and reimagine everyday work and life,” said Nadella. “As tech as a percentage of global GDP continues to increase, we are innovating and investing across diverse and growing markets, with a common underlying technology stack and an operating model that reinforces a common strategy, culture and sense of purpose.”","The Seattle-based software giant reported revenues of $51.7bn, an increase of 20% compared to the same period last year and ahead of expectations.

51,51,"Users of self-driving cars should have immunity from a wide range of motoring offences, including dangerous driving, speeding and jumping red lights, Britain’s law commissions have jointly recommended. The Law Commission for England and Wales and the Scottish Law Commission propose creation of an Automated Vehicles Act to reflect the “profound legal consequences” of self-driving cars. The person in the driving seat would no longer responsible for how the car drives; instead, the company or body that obtained authorisation for the self-driving vehicle would face regulatory sanctions if anything went wrong. In a summary of the report, published on Wednesday, the commissions say: “While a vehicle is driving itself, we do not think that a human should be required to respond to events in the absence of a transition demand (a requirement for the driver to take control). It is unrealistic to expect someone who is not paying attention to the road to deal with (for example) a tyre blow-out or a closed road sign. Even hearing ambulance sirens will be difficult for those with a hearing impairment or listening to loud music.” The report says that there should be a clear distinction between driver support and self-driving and that a vehicle should only be classified as the latter if it is safe even when an individual is not monitoring the driving environment, the vehicle or the way that it drives. The commissions say it should be permissible for an autonomous car to create a transition demand for the driver to take control if it confronts an issue it cannot deal with but it must make the demand in a clear fashion, give the individual sufficient time to respond and be able to mitigate the risk if a human fails to take over, by at least coming to a stop. In the US, Tesla’s self-driving technology, sold under the brand names Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, have been involved in multiple crashes, including several fatalities, when neither the system nor the driver intervened. The US Department of Transportation is reviewing Tesla’s use of the term “full self-driving”. In Britain, the commissions recommend new safeguards to stop driver assistance features from being marketed as self-driving. Public law commissioner Nicholas Paines QC said the recommendations presented “an unprecedented opportunity to promote public acceptance of automated vehicles”. Transport minister Trudy Harrison said: “The development of self-driving vehicles in the UK has the potential to revolutionise travel, making every day journeys safer, easier and greener. “This government has been encouraging development and deployment of these technologies to understand their benefits. However, we must ensure we have the right regulations in place, based upon safety and accountability, in order to build public confidence. That’s why the department funded this independent report.” Under the recommendations, which will now be considered by the respective governments, the user-in-charge of a self-driving vehicle would still retain responsibilities such as such as carrying insurance and ensuring that children wear seatbelts. Where vehicles are authorised to drive themselves without anyone in the driver seat, a licensed operator would be responsible for overseeing the journey.","The person in the driving seat would no longer responsible for how the car drives; instead, the company or body that obtained authorisation for the self-driving vehicle would face regulatory sanctions if anything went wrong.

52,52,"Microsoft’s second attempt at its interesting dual-screen Android smartphone corrects some mistakes of the original, but falls short of a revolution due to a series of oddities created by its physical laptop-like form. Looking more like a tiny convertible computer than a phone, the Surface Duo 2 starts at £1,349 ($1,499/A$2,319), a lot for a regular smartphone but slightly cheaper than folding-screen rivals. It opens like a book, with each half just 5.5mm thick, and a hinge that allows it to fold all the way over. Inside are a pair of 90Hz OLED screens each measuring 5.8in on the diagonal. They can be used on their own or combined as one display measuring 8.3in – a similar size to an iPad mini. Both screens are covered in traditional scratch-resistant smartphone glass and have large, old-fashioned bezels top and bottom. Having two separate displays rather than one that folds in half creates a major drawback: a gap in the middle of the screen big enough that you can see through it, which is much harder to ignore than the crease in the middle of a flexible display as found on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3. You can use two different apps at the same time on the two screens. The theory is sound, but I found few pairings were useful beyond simple messaging apps and a browser. More useful was using one screen for a note-taking app and the other for a full keyboard like a mini laptop. Some apps spanned across both displays, like Outlook, can put different information on each screen, such as your inbox on one side and an open message on the other. Some games, including Asphalt 9 and Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass streaming service, put controls on one screen and the action on the other. But there are very few apps and games optimised for this setup. Specifications Screens: two 5.8in AMOLED 90Hz displays Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 RAM: 8GB of RAM Storage: 128, 256 or 512GB Operating system: Android 11 Cameras: 12MP wide, 16MP ultra-wide, 12MP 2x telephoto; 12MP selfie Connectivity: 5G, USB-C, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5.1 and location Water resistance: IPX1 (dripping water) Dimensions closed: 145.2 x 92.1 x 11.0mm Dimensions open: 145.2 x 184.5 x 5.5mm Weight: 284g 2021’s top Android chip The Duo 2 has last year’s top Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip with 8GB of RAM, matching the performance of top-flight Android smartphones from 2021 and capable of running two apps running side-by-side without slowdown. Battery life is more variable than a traditional phone. It lasts about 32 hours between charges, with both screens used for about four hours with a variety of messaging, browsing and work apps. It lasts about a third longer if you mostly use only one screen. That’s a considerably shorter battery life than a regular smartphone and behind the Z Fold 3. Sustainability Microsoft does not provide an expected lifespan for the Duo 2’s battery; those in similar devices typically maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for in excess of 500 full charge cycles. Microsoft charges an out-of-warranty service fee of £593.94 to repair devices and £568.44 to replace the battery. The previous generation Surface Duo scored only two out of 10 on iFixit’s repairability scale. The phone contains no recycled materials, but Microsoft operates recycling schemes for old devices, publishes a company-wide sustainability report and a breakdown of each product’s environmental impact. Android 11 The Duo 2 runs Android 11 – not the latest Android 12 – and generally behaves like a standard Android smartphone or tablet with a few small additions that make it easier to use each screen separately. One of the best is the ability to drag the gesture bar at the bottom of an app to move it between screens or to drop it on to the gap between the screens to span it across both displays. The software can be a bit unpredictable at times, such as opening the keyboard or text box of an app on another screen or hiding a second app from the screen when you try to type. But it is generally a fast and responsive experience given how unusual the device is. The Duo 2 will receive three years of software updates from release, including monthly security patches, which is disappointingly at least a year short of what rivals, including Samsung and Apple, offer. Microsoft’s last planned update for the Duo 2 will be 21 October 2024. Camera The Duo 2 has a triple camera on the back and a 12-megapixel selfie camera above the right-hand screen. The rear main 12MP camera and 2x telephoto cameras are good, capable of producing detailed shots in a range of lighting conditions. The 16MP ultra-wide camera is reasonable, but a bit soft on detail and struggles with challenging scenes. The camera app has most of the features you’d expect, such as portrait mode, night mode and slow-mo video, and can shoot regular video at up to 4K at 60 frames a second. The 12MP selfie camera is capable of shooting detailed photos even in middling light, and has access to the dedicated night mode when it gets dark. Overall, the camera system on the Duo 2 is solid, but it can’t hold a candle to the best in the business. Observations The Duo 2 supports Microsoft’s Slim Pen stylus, which can be magnetically stored and charged on the back of the device when not in use. The stereo speakers are decently loud but a bit tinny, fine for watching YouTube videos. The width of the device makes it a challenge to fit into smaller pockets. Price The Surface Duo 2 costs £1,349 ($1,499/A$2,319) with 128GB, £1,429 ($1,599/A$2,469) with 256GB or £1,589 ($1,799/A$2,769) with 512GB of storage. For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 costs £1,599 and the Galaxy Z Flip 3 costs £949. Verdict The Surface Duo 2 is an improvement on its predecessor, but is still a very odd proposition that’s neither a good phone nor a good tablet. The individual screens are short and stout, forcing lots of scrolling in apps when using it like a phone and making one-handed use very difficult. The gap at the hinge makes combining them into one big tablet screen awkward too. Using two apps side-by-side works well, but few combinations proved useful or faster than just quick switching between two apps on one screen on a normal phone. There is more potential in apps like Outlook that provide a multi-pane view, but few apps or games are optimised for the dual-screen system. Microsoft is only offering a disappointing three years of software and security updates from release for the Duo 2, too, losing it a star. It is good to see Microsoft trying something different. But ultimately the Duo 2’s two screens are just not yet as good or useful as either a single phone screen or a bigger folding screen, making it an expensive halfway house. Pros: two screens, two apps side-by-side, multiple modes, top performance, hardened glass screens, decent camera, head-turning design. Cons: gap between screens, few optimised apps, average battery life, bulky camera lump, chunky in pocket, hard to use one-handed, no real water resistance, only three years of software updates from release.

53,53,"When bitcoin mining company Bit Digital started shipping its energy-intensive computers out of China in early 2021, eyebrows were raised. “A lot of people thought we were being overly paranoid,” says chief strategy officer Samir Tabar, who helped relocate all of the company’s machines to the US and Canada. But the company’s paranoia paid off. China’s bitcoin mining ban last summer, driven partly by environmental concerns, sent the industry spinning into chaos. The announcement sparked a fire sale of the computers used to power bitcoin, with mining companies scrambling to ship more than 2m of the machines out of China. They arrived by the crateload in countries like the US, Russia and Kazakhstan. China was home to about 65% of global bitcoin production in 2020, according to an estimate by the University of Cambridge. Although the country banned bitcoin mining for a number of reasons, one was the massive energy consumption bitcoin required and the impediment that posed to China’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2060. Chinese regulators aren’t the only ones concerned by bitcoin mining’s environmental impact. The latest calculation from Cambridge University’s bitcoin electricity consumption index estimates that bitcoin mining consumes 133.63 terawatt hours a year of electricity – more than the entire countries of Ukraine and Norway. This figure keeps growing: bitcoin mining currently uses 66 times more electricity than in 2015. Bitcoiners like to say that China’s ban proved the resilience of the network. Although the “hashrate” – a measure of the global computing power dedicated to mining bitcoin – plummeted around the time of the crackdown, it had recovered by the end of the year. But bitcoin’s energy consumption now poses an existential threat to the mining industry, with a growing number of lawmakers around the world eager to follow China’s lead. Kazakhstan initially welcomed China’s stranded bitcoin miners as a potential boon to the economy. Lured by the promise of lax regulation and cheap coal power, an estimated fifth of global bitcoin mining production migrated there. But bitcoin’s rapacious energy demand created intense pressure on Kazakhstan’s ageing energy grid this winter. The threat of emergency blackouts soon led the government to permit grid operators to limit power supply to miners, leaving some facilities without power. Even in renewable energy havens, the future of bitcoin mining is far from assured. Iceland, which gets almost all of its energy from renewables, won’t welcome any more bitcoin miners to its shores. Regulators in Sweden say that bitcoin mining siphons energy from more productive industries, and are currently lobbying the EU to ban the practice outright. Norway-based bitcoin miner Arcane’s CEO Torbjørn Bull Jenssen dismisses this as a “very planned-economy approach”. But even in the free-market-loving US, an increasing number of lawmakers are souring on the industry. In theory, a greener bitcoin is possible. The digital coin’s energy consumption is tied to its underlying “proof-of-work” protocol (PoW). This is the decentralised consensus mechanism that secures the currency and prevents fraud or hacking, in the absence of oversight from banks or another centralised body. The role of bitcoin miners is essentially to verify transactions on the blockchain. Think of bitcoin mining as a contest where miners compete to solve complex cryptographic puzzles. The “winner” adds the next block of transactions to the distributed ledger (ie, the blockchain) and claims payment in the form of new bitcoins and a transaction fee. The miner using the most computing power is likely to solve the problem fastest, creating the incentive to expend more energy in order to “win”. This ballooning energy consumption is fuelling the popularity of a less energy-intensive alternative: proof-of-stake (PoS). Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of Tezos, a blockchain platform that allows users to create smart contracts, says that a friend of hers ran a cryptography mailing list when bitcoin was first announced. “Arguably the first bitcoin sceptic”, his first reaction was, “‘If this is successful, it’s going to absorb all the energy in the universe, and it’s going to be terrible.’” Tezos is built on PoS instead, which uses a consensus mechanism different from bitcoin’s. Rather than “miners” competing with computing power, different nodes of the distributed network compete by committing “stakes” of tokens. Staking a greater number of tokens – which risk being forfeited in the event of fraud – increases the likelihood that a node will be selected by an algorithm to produce the next block of transactions, receiving rewards in the form of more tokens. Because it’s the “stake” (ie, the number of tokens) rather than “work” (ie, energy expenditure) that secures the network, PoS reduces network power demand by more than 99% relative to PoW. Instead of warehouses stacked high with purpose-built machines, PoS can run on a dinky Raspberry Pi microcomputer. Although Breitman says environmental concerns aren’t what pushed her blockchain to pick PoS, it’s becoming more advantageous as scrutiny on PoW ramps up. Ethereum, the second-largest public blockchain after bitcoin, is planning to shift to PoS by the end of 2022, and a number of new blockchain applications such as Cardano and Polkadot have chosen to launch using this protocol. The European Commission is among the regulatory bodies trying to incentivise the industry to migrate applications from PoW to PoS but the bitcoin network has so far resisted any such move. It’s not that bitcoiners don’t care about the environmental impact – although a vocal minority on social media might give this impression, says digital assets lead at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF), Michel Rauchs. The issue is that a majority of bitcoiners remain adamant that PoS is not a worthy replacement for PoW. Many bitcoiners believe that PoS subverts the fundamental principles of a decentralised currency that must remain outside the reach of governments and the banking system. “The problem with proof-of-stake is that it’s not trustless and it’s not censorship-resistant, and it’s not objective,” says Chris Bendiksen, research lead at digital assets investment company CoinShares. “There’s no real difference from a high-level perspective between proof-of-stake and consensus shareholder capitalism… Proof-of-stake is not a replacement for proof-of-work, it’s just a return to the pre-bitcoin system.” Some bitcoiners claim that the environmental debate is overblown because energy usage will fall over the coming years. This is because the profit miners receive for minting new coins is programmed to halve roughly every four years. Eventually, all bitcoins will be mined and miners will only receive transaction fees. “Since the [payment in the form of new coins] will go away and transaction fees won’t go up, electricity consumption will end up being much lower than the doomsayers believe,” says Pierre Rochard, a longtime bitcoin investor and developer. In other words, shrinking rewards should shrink the pool of competing miners. Whether or not this will be the case, reluctance to rewire bitcoin’s underlying protocol tosses the ball back into the bitcoin miners’ court to tackle the issue of energy consumption. They’re rising to the challenge – at least in rhetoric. Bitcoin mining is the cleanest and most efficient use of energy in the world out of any major industry, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, founder of the Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC), said in a recent briefing. “The only way you get more sustainable and more efficient would be to create an imaginary industry.” (More imaginary than bitcoin, that is.) The BMC is a body of bitcoin miners set up last year to address growing concerns over the cryptocurrency’s energy consumption. Its purpose is to promote sustainability within the industry, but it’s also part of the fightback against bitcoin’s image problem. The headline figure promoted at the meeting was that bitcoin accounts for only 0.1% of the Earth’s total energy consumption – which sounds a lot smaller than the frequent comparisons to small countries. (The 0.1% figure caught on fast among bitcoin miners – several quoted it to the Observer.) Rauchs said that the 0.1% figure sounded “roughly in line” with CCAF’s data. What’s more, 58% of the energy used to power the industry is sustainable according to the BMC. A report from CCAF in 2020 estimated this figure at a more conservative 39%, but Rauchs stresses this was only a snapshot of energy consumption at that moment in time, and couldn’t comment on the reliability of the BMC’s estimate without seeing the underlying data. Some bitcoiners argue that the cryptocurrency could incentivise a more rapid shift to renewable energy. Because bitcoin mining operations don’t have to be switched on all the time, they pair well with the intermittent nature of renewable energy according to the argument, and can compel energy companies to increase renewable energy capacity, as well as helping to balance the grid. Bitcoin mining company Marathon Digital Holdings, which runs operations in Nebraska, Texas and South Dakota, claims to have such agreements with power providers. “The company that generates the electricity can tell us to shut down our mining rigs,” says its CEO Fred Thiel, meaning “they’ll all of a sudden have 100-200 megawatts – whatever amount we’re consuming – available to put into the grid at a moment’s notice. We act like a big battery.” There isn’t evidence that this is happening at scale yet, says Rauchs, although it could become more important in future. However, bitcoin mining is not particularly unique in this regard, says Arvind Ravikumar, a petroleum researcher at the University of Texas at Austin. Electric vehicle charging and so-called “tier zero” data centres that don’t support critical functions are also suited to these “demand response” arrangements that can be paired with renewable energy on the grid, he says. “The idea that you have to create a new demand, like bitcoin mining, is not correct.” And the flipside is where growing energy demands incentivise defunct fossil fuel-powered stations to come back online. Controversially, bitcoin mining company Greenidge Generation Holdings reopened a former coal power plant in Dresden, New York, and converted it to natural gas, causing the plant’s greenhouse gas emissions to increase almost tenfold between 2019 and 2020. Discussions about Bitcoin’s energy consumption tend to wind up in a philosophical cul-de-sac about the inherent utility of the industry. Critics contend that this utility is zero, which can provoke defensiveness in its advocates. “There are old-school bitcoiners who are like, ‘Who cares about the energy consumption? Bitcoin deserves to exist,’” says Breitman. “It becomes an argument about values.” Many allege that energy overuse is simply the latest stick with which to beat bitcoin, and that the industry is subject to unfair moral scrutiny compared to others – like gold mining or Wall Street day trading. Rauchs is “actually pretty sympathetic” to that argument, saying bitcoiners are correct that hyperbole about bitcoin destroying years of climate progress is “completely out of proportion”. Whichever way you slice it, eliminating bitcoin isn’t a fast-track solution to global heating. Ravikumar says the most important issue is what the industry is doing to reduce emissions. “That’s the question we need to be focusing on – rather than what, if any, are the benefits of Bitcoin mining.”","Although the “hashrate” – a measure of the global computing power dedicated to mining bitcoin – plummeted around the time of the crackdown, it had recovered by the end of the year. “Arguably the first bitcoin sceptic”, his first reaction was, “‘If this is successful, it’s going to absorb all the energy in the universe, and it’s going to be terrible.’” Tezos is built on PoS instead, which uses a consensus mechanism different from bitcoin’s.

54,54,"It’s someone’s nightmare job: Amazon boss Jeff Bezos’s newspaper, the Washington Post, is seeking a special correspondent just to cover the billionaire’s online shopping and web services titan. Having your own chronicler could be seen as the ultimate in billionaire egotism, but we are all close Amazon watchers now. The group’s tentacles have spread into so many areas of our lives that it is almost impossible to escape – from its cloud storage technology that supports government services and numerous businesses, to its Prime subscription service tying clients into an “ecosystem” that ranges from film and music to shopping deliveries, to the Alexa-driven smart speakers that turn on lights and radios in many homes and search the internet while logging intimate user data. Covid-19 may have knocked the sales and profits of many businesses, but Amazon was a standout pandemic winner, notching up millions of new recruits who turned to online streaming and shopping while shielding at home. In Britain, 56% of households are now thought to have had access to Prime Video after almost 700,000 more people signed up in the final quarter of last year, according to analysts at Kantar. On Thursday, Amazon will reveal the extent to which it has been able to hold on to those new customers as high streets reopened while the costs and complexities of serving shoppers increased. Widespread supply chain hold-ups, with some factories shut during Covid scares and shipping routes disrupted, are expected to have affected its ability to obtain and deliver products. The cost of delivering has also gone up, as Amazon has had to battle for staff and invest in additional logistical kit amid a global surge in demand for home deliveries. In the UK, it increased pay for warehouse workers and offered signing-on bonuses of up to £3,000 before Christmas to attract staff, as well as offering more than £11 an hour in some parts of the country – three pounds more than the current minimum wage. Meanwhile, shoppers now have more chance to try clothes on in boutiques, go on holiday or venture out to bars and clubs – meaning less cash to splash on Amazon. Such problems have already hit the share prices of tech companies, from online fashion sellers Asos and Boohoo to streaming service Netflix. At Amazon, difficulties prompted a disappointing performance in the three months to the end of September when the company reported its biggest year-on-year profits decline since 2017. Another fall is expected for the Christmas quarter. Overall, analysts expect fourth-quarter revenues of $137.7bn (£102.8bn) and operating profits of $2.6bn: a 9%-plus increase in revenues on the same period a year before, but a chunky 60% fall in quarterly profit. Costly investments in chartering cargo ships and leasing planes are expected to have given Amazon a degree of protection from the global supply chain issues. However, almost a third of its packages are delivered by partner companies. Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush, says: “Industry-wide shortages in shipping containers, truck drivers, and readily available ports likely impacted delivery times and caused strain for many orders as shipping container [rates] surged from under $2,000 before the pandemic to over $20,000 with multi-week delays.” On the demand side, it is not plain sailing either. In groceries, for example, Natalie Berg, a retail analyst and co-author of a book on Amazon, says: “All the things that made Amazon unique, such as same-day delivery and checkout-free stores, are quite quickly becoming the norm.” In the booming world of fast-track groceries, the likes of Getir, Gopuff and Gorillas promise to deliver in less than 15 minutes, and are battling with Amazon partner Deliveroo and its rivals Just Eat and Uber Eats, as well as Tesco’s own Whoosh and Sainsbury’s Chop Chop in the UK. Meanwhile, Amazon has opened about 15 of its “just walk out” till-less grocery stores in the UK, but it is already facing a challenge in this area from Tesco and Aldi – and plenty of competition from regular local convenience stores. A tie-up with Sainsbury’s, which is using Amazon technology to power its just-walk-out store, may suggest a more lucrative way forward. Don’t be surprised if Amazon brings hi-tech physical fashion stores to the UK before long too. If shoppers are keen, the tech giant’s real assault on the high street will be via partnering with more familiar brands with better fashion credentials. All of this will fuel the appetite to take on the dominance of big tech firms. In the US, a change of regime is being led by Lina Khan, the new boss of the Federal Trade Commission, who made her name helping guide investigations into monopoly tech power, particularly Amazon. Historically, taking on monopoly businesses has been a slow and arduous process. But Khan showed her ambition in the first meeting she chaired last summer, saying the US needed “a different set of rules” to control big tech.","The group’s tentacles have spread into so many areas of our lives that it is almost impossible to escape – from its cloud storage technology that supports government services and numerous businesses, to its Prime subscription service tying clients into an “ecosystem” that ranges from film and music to shopping deliveries, to the Alexa-driven smart speakers that turn on lights and radios in many homes and search the internet while logging intimate user data.

In groceries, for example, Natalie Berg, a retail analyst and co-author of a book on Amazon, says: “All the things that made Amazon unique, such as same-day delivery and checkout-free stores, are quite quickly becoming the norm.” In the booming world of fast-track groceries, the likes of Getir, Gopuff and Gorillas promise to deliver in less than 15 minutes, and are battling with Amazon partner Deliveroo and its rivals Just Eat and Uber Eats, as well as Tesco’s own Whoosh and Sainsbury’s Chop Chop in the UK.

55,55,"A new, cheaper alternative to the AirPods Pro is here – and it is also from Apple. The Beats Fit Pro have many of the same features but cost £40 less, are more workout-friendly than their cousins and work with Android, too. Priced at £199 ($199.99/A$299.95) they offer the same noise-cancelling as the AirPods Pro and features such as spatial audio virtual surround sound. The Fit Pro essentially add a flexible silicone stabiliser “wing” to the top of last year’s Studio Buds. Once you twist the wing into the top of your ear they stay put even with the most vigorous of exercise, or you can wear them without the wing tucked in for more sedate listening. The top of the earbud protrudes a little from your ear and has a single multi-purpose “b” button which you press once, twice, thrice or press and hold to skip tracks, change sound modes or adjust the volume. The music pauses when you remove an earbud too. The earbuds clip magnetically into a flip-top case for charging and storage, which is like a mini version of the giant Powerbeats Pro case. It is a bit bigger than the best on the market but still just about fits in the money pocket of a pair of jeans. The earbuds last up to six hours of playback with noise-cancelling active between charges, which is two hours short of the best rivals but at least an hour longer than the Studio Buds and AirPods Pro. Specifications Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.0, SBC, AAC, H1 chip Battery life: six hours ANC playback (24 hours with case) Water resistance: IPX4 (splash resistant) Earbud dimensions: 30x 24 x 19mm Earbud weight: 5.6g each Charging case dimensions: 62 x 62 x 28.5mm Charging case weight: 55.1g Case charging: USB-C Great sound and noise cancelling The Fit Pro sound really good, particularly for fitness-focused earbuds. They have a well-balanced and fully rounded sound that suits a variety of genres. They can produce deep notes with a thump when needed but the bass is kept from overriding the good treble and high notes. Vocals are excellent, instrument separation is good and they handle complex tracks well. They sound similar to Apple’s AirPods Pro, and slightly better than the Studio Buds, but can’t quite match the very best-sounding earbuds from Sony. It is a similar story for the noise-cancelling. The Fit Pro match the efficacy of the AirPods Pro, successfully reducing low rumbles, cars and fans, while struggling with higher-pitched noise such as the tapping of fingers on a keyboard. The ambient awareness mode is one of the more natural-sounding of those available, good for listening out for announcements or a quick conversation. Spatial audio In addition to standard stereo sound, the Fit Pro have Apple’s spatial audio virtual surround sound technology, thanks to their H1 chip. It makes the audio sound as if it is coming from a collection of speakers around you rather than directed straight down your ear canal, giving it a greater atmosphere. When used with Apple devices, the earbuds track the movement of your head and adjust the sound so that it is always centred on the screen in front of you. It works particularly well for movies and TV shows with a Dolby sound track but also works with music, too. It’s all very clever. Unlike Apple’s AirPods, the Fit Pro support some elements of spatial audio on Android, but not the head tracking and other advanced features. Apple and Android The same story exists for other features on Apple versus Android. The Fit Pro support the same instant pairing, seamless switching between devices, instant “Hey Siri” access to the voice assistant, battery status notifications and audio sharing with Apple gear as the AirPods. They are standard Bluetooth 5.0 earbuds and will connect just fine to most devices, including Windows PCs. But unlike Apple’s other earbuds, the Beats support some of the more advanced features on Android including instant pairing, battery status, customisable controls, firmware updates and the ear tip fit test using the Beats app. Observations If you use a mix of Apple and Android gear, the Beats app on Android will not be able to “find” the earbuds unless you turn off Bluetooth on nearby iPhones or iPads. Call quality was really good for such compact earbuds: my voice sounded clear and natural with only a little background noise leaking through in loud environments. Sustainability Apple expects the batteries to last more than 500 full charge cycles while maintaining at least 80% of their original capacity but they are not replaceable. While some minor bits of the earbuds are repairable, they scored a zero out of 10 on iFixit’s repairability scale. Apple offers a “battery service” for £76.44 or replacements costing £96.44 each. The earbuds and case are made from recycled plastic and rare earth elements but Apple does not publish environmental impact reports for accessories such as headphones. The company offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Price The Beats Fit Pro cost £199 ($199.99/A$299.95). For comparison, the AirPods Pro cost £239, the AirPods 3 cost £169, the Beats Studio Buds cost £130, the Jabra Elite 7 Pro cost £199 and the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 cost £99. Verdict The Beats Fit Pro offer a slice of the earbud magic found in Apple’s AirPods Pro in a sportier, cheaper form. They sound good, have effective noise-cancelling and solid battery life. The spatial audio virtual surround sound system is really great with Apple gear and some of the smart features are available on Android, too. They are small and don’t have stalks. The wing design keeps them locked in place but can take some fiddling to get comfortable. The charging case is a bit larger than I would like but still pocketable. They are bettered on sound, noise-cancelling and battery life by the very best. And, unfortunately, the battery cannot be replaced, ultimately making them disposable and losing a star. But if you want a set of all-purpose earbuds for iPhone or Android that can silence the commute, do justice to movies on your phone and stay put when it’s time to pound the pavement, there aren’t many better than the Beats Fit Pro. Pros: great sound and noise-cancelling, decent battery and case, great connectivity, good controls, advanced features with Apple devices including spatial audio, some special features with Android, rock-solid fit for exercise or commute, decent call quality Cons: can be a fiddle to get comfortable, charging case larger than rivals, no wireless charging, only IPX4 sweat resistance, cannot be repaired, expensive.","The Fit Pro match the efficacy of the AirPods Pro, successfully reducing low rumbles, cars and fans, while struggling with higher-pitched noise such as the tapping of fingers on a keyboard.

56,56,"Spotify is adding a message that will direct listeners to correct Covid-19 information as controversy over misinformation shared on Joe Rogan’s podcast continues to grow, with the streamer losing billions in market value and more musicians withdrawing their music. On Sunday, the CEO of Spotify, Daniel Ek, released an official statement setting out the streaming platform’s plan to tackle misinformation. New content advisories will direct listeners of any podcast that discusses coronavirus to a dedicated website that “provides easy access to data-driven facts, up-to-date information as shared by scientists, physicians, academics and public health authorities around the world, as well as links to trusted sources”. Spotify’s rules for its creators have also been made public for the first time, with users told they cannot publish “content that promotes dangerous false or dangerous deceptive medical information that may cause offline harm or poses a direct threat to public health”. Examples include calling Covid “a hoax or not real” or “encouraging people to purposely get infected with Covid-19 in order to build immunity to it”. Users who break the rule could see their content removed from the platform and repeat offenders could be suspended or banned. “You’ve had a lot of questions over the last few days about our platform policies and the lines we have drawn between what is acceptable and what is not. We have had rules in place for many years but admittedly, we haven’t been transparent around the policies that guide our content more broadly,” Ek’s statement said. Ek wrote that the content advisories will roll out “around the world in the coming days.” “To our knowledge, this content advisory is the first of its kind by a major podcast platform,” he added. Rogan, a comedian and host of The Joe Rogan Experience, has sparked controversy for repeatedly spreading misinformation about Covid on his show, including the conspiracy theory that hospitals are financially incentivised to record Covid as cause of death. He has also promoted the use of ivermectin, an anti-parasitic treatment used mainly on animals, to treat Covid symptoms. It has not been proved to be effective at preventing or treating Covid. Last week, musician Neil Young asked his management to remove his music from Spotify, citing misinformation on Rogan’s podcast: “I am doing this because Spotify is spreading false information about vaccines – potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them … They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.” After removing his music, Spotify said it regretted “Neil’s decision … but hope to welcome him back soon”. Their shares dropped 6% over two days, then recovered slightly – before musician Joni Mitchell announced she would also remove her music from the platform. “Irresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives,” Mitchell wrote. “I stand in solidarity with Neil Young and the global scientific and medical communities on this issue.” Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who signed a multi-year podcast partnership with Spotify for their company, Archewell Audio, said in a statement that they had expressed concerns about misinformation to Spotify last year. “We have continued to express our concerns to Spotify to ensure changes to its platform are made to help address this public health crisis. We look to Spotify to meet this moment and are committed to continuing our work together as it does,” a spokesperson for the couple said. As of Sunday, Spotify had lost more than US$2bn (£1.5bn) in market value and removed more than 20,000 episodes of podcasts that were related to Covid-19, in accordance with its “detailed content policies”. Calls on social media for people to cancel their Spotify subscriptions have intensified over the last week. The company has not disclosed how many users have left, but a message from its customer support team to subscribers said they were “getting a lot of contacts so may be slow to respond”. Spotify acquired Rogan’s show in 2020, in a deal worth more than $100m. The Joe Rogan Experience is now Spotify’s most popular podcast and one of the biggest in the world.","Spotify is adding a message that will direct listeners to correct Covid-19 information as controversy over misinformation shared on Joe Rogan’s podcast continues to grow, with the streamer losing billions in market value and more musicians withdrawing their music.

The company reported revenues of $75.3bn for the three months ending 31 December, up 32% compared to last year, and a profit of $20.6bn, comfortably beating analysts’ expectations. Alphabet’s shares rose close to 7% in after-hours trading.

58,58,"A historic plunge in the stock price of Facebook’s parent company has erased more than $230bn in its market value, easily the biggest one-day loss in history for a US company. The 26.4% wipeout in Meta comes amid concerns about its future after the company reported its first ever drop in daily user numbers in its Wednesday earnings report. Facebook rebranded to Meta last year as part of its strategic pivot to becoming a virtual-reality based company. The company’s advertising model has also been hit hard by privacy changes at Apple, which Facebook has said it expects will cost them billions. The slump in stock price has sent Mark Zuckerberg’s personal wealth tumbling by nearly $30bn. Meta’s stock fall marked the biggest slide in market value for a US public company, according to a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data. It was a disappointment for a company that investors have become accustomed to delivering spectacular growth. Meta also reported a rare decline in profit due to a sharp increase in expenses as it invests in the “metaverse”. “Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg may be keen to coax the world into an alternate reality, but disappointing fourth-quarter results were quick to burst his metaverse bubble,” said Laura Hoy, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. On a Wednesday call with investors, Zuckerberg said he was “proud” of the work the company had done last year but acknowledged the company faced tough competition for attention from rivals including TikTok. The fall of Meta’s stock helped yank other tech stocks lower on Wall Street on Thursday, abruptly ending a four-day winning streak for the market. The stocks of other social media companies including Twitter and Snap also fell. Spotify also slumped 16.8% after the leading music-streaming service gave investors a weak forecast for a closely watched measure of its earnings. The company has come under pressure after Neil Young pulled his music from its platform to protest the spreading of Covid misinformation by Spotify’s star podcaster, Joe Rogan. Big US tech-focused companies have come under mounting pressure in 2022 as investors expect policy tightening at the US Federal Reserve to erode the industry’s rich valuations following years of ultra-low interest rates. The Nasdaq, which is dominated by tech and other growth stocks, fell more than 9% in January, its worst monthly drop since the coronavirus-induced market crash in March 2020. “The downgrade in the earnings outlook by Meta and other companies took markets by surprise,” said Kenneth Broux, a strategist at Societe Generale in London. “The tech selloff spilled over to broader equity markets this morning and with the Fed preparing to raise interest rates, we could see more volatility going forward,” he said. With big tech firms like Apple and Microsoft ballooning in valuations in the past few years, they have also become more susceptible to investor whiplash, often resulting in losses worth tens of billions of dollars in a single day of trade. Apple shed nearly $180bn on 3 September 2020, while Microsoft lost $177bn on 16 March in the same year. The disappointment over Meta’s earnings and the subsequent stock fall invoked memories of the bursting tech bubble in 2000. Big technology and communications companies played a big role in driving gains for the broader market throughout the pandemic and much of the recovery in 2021, but the market seems to have shifted, said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. “There’s a general sense that what’s been moving the market higher is not going to take us to the next level,” McMillan said. “The question is where is the next growth engine coming from.”","A historic plunge in the stock price of Facebook’s parent company has erased more than $230bn in its market value, easily the biggest one-day loss in history for a US company.

59,59,"Uber’s food delivery service Uber Eats has turned profitable for the first time, the company said on Wednesday, in an earnings report that revealed it may be bouncing back after a rough run during lockdown. Shares rose 6.8% in after-hours trading after the company’s report showed $5.8bn in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021, beating estimates of $5.36bn. It said demand for its ride-hailing service was again approaching pre-pandemic levels. “In Q4, more consumers were active on our platform than ever before,” said Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive officer, in a statement. Still, Uber forecast lower-than-expected adjusted profit in the first three months of 2022, as the Omicron coronavirus variant dampened travel demand in January. Lyft, Uber’s main rival in the US, issued a similar warning on Tuesday. In its own earnings, Lyft also reported an upward recovery trajectory tempered by the Omicron surge. It said per-rider revenue reached nearly $52 in the fourth quarter – a 13.5% increase from the third quarter and the highest amount in the company’s nearly 10-year history. While riders continued returning to Lyft compared with 2020 levels, ridership in the fourth quarter decreased by roughly 1% versus the prior quarter and ridership remains 30% below pre-Covid levels. Uber forecast its first-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), a measure that excludes one-time costs, primarily stock-based compensation, to come in between $100m and $130m. The company said business had started picking up into February. “Our results demonstrate just how far we’ve come since the beginning of the pandemic,” Khosrowshahi said, adding that the company may also be bouncing back from the recent wave of Covid infections, with gross bookings up 25% month-on-month in the most recent week. Uber’s delivery unit, largely made up of its Uber Eats restaurant service, posted its first adjusted EBITDA profit of $25m, showing Uber’s ability to scale the once loss-making operation against strong competition. Delivery emerged as one of the company’s main strengths during the pandemic. Steady delivery bookings signal that the rebound in rides has not come at the expense of food delivery, with consumers sticking to the service even as the economy reopens. The California-based company reported adjusted EBITDA of $86m for the quarter that ended on 31 December. That compared with a loss on the same basis of $454m a year ago and was significantly ahead of analyst expectations for $62.03m in the fourth quarter. Uber also posted net income of $892m, as it revalued its stakes in Southeast-Asian Grab and self-driving company Aurora Innovation, just a quarter after it reported a $2.42bn net loss driven by its stake in Chinese ride service Didi and stock-based compensation.

60,60,"Songs that claim Covid-19 is fake and describe the vaccines as “poison” are being actively promoted to Spotify users in playlists generated by its content recommendation engine. Tracks found on the world’s largest music streaming service explicitly encourage people not to get vaccinated and say those who do are “slaves”, “sheep”, and victims of Satan. Others call for an uprising, urging listeners to “fight for your life”. “They fooled the whole world with PCR testing. The thought police are patrolling. Can’t you see what’s unfolding?” say the lyrics of another, adding: “The whole thing ends once the people have risen.” Spotify this weekend removed several of the songs flagged to it by the Observer, which it said breached rules banning content that promotes “dangerous, false, or deceptive content about Covid-19” that may pose a threat to public health. Before being removed, the songs could be easily found using keywords through Spotify’s search tool. But they were also actively promoted to users who express interest in similar songs via automatically generated playlists, potentially bringing them to a far wider audience. One user who played a song containing anti-vaccine lyrics was given a personalised playlist directing them to even more extreme songsOf the 50 songs in that playlist, 19 included explicit references to anti-vaccine and Covid misinformation, including claims the vaccine is being used to microchip people. Some had references to other conspiracy theories, including claims that satanic paedophiles run the world, and that the Sandy Hook school shooting in the US, which left 26 dead, was a hoax. Among the artists whose content was recommended to users was Edward Freeman, a rapper known as Remeece, who made headlines in the UK after touring schools blasting his anti-vaccine anthem Don’t Tek Di Vaccine to pupils outside school gates. The lyrics of the song – among those that remained live on Spotify last week – repeatedly say “don’t tek the damn thing” and “you mad”, and describe the vaccine as “poison”. Remeece has visited primary and secondary schools in London, Cornwall and Bournemouth, according to videos posted on his Instagram feed. In December, he was filmed performing the song at a protest with Piers Corbyn, a key figure in the UK’s anti-vaccine movement. Spotify has long been aware it is hosting the rapper’s content – which was first reported to Spotify by a concerned parent in November, according to emails seen by the Observer. His material remained live without any content warning last week. The findings have stoked debate about the streaming giant’s handling of misinformation, with critics calling for the platform – and other streaming services hosting similar material – to be held to the same standard as traditional social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. Spotify, which has more than 180 million users, has recently faced criticism over its relationship with podcaster Joe Rogan, who it signed in an exclusive deal for a reported $100m. Several artists including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell demanded their content be removed from Spotify in protest at Rogan’s alleged role in spreading misinformation about Covid-19, and 270 US doctors, scientists, healthcare professionals and professors wrote to the platform calling Rogan “a menace to public health” for airing anti-vaccine ideology. Guests on his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, have included Robert Malone, a controversial infectious-disease researcher who was involved in the development of mRNA vaccine technology but has been criticised for spreading vaccine misinformation. In response to that criticism, Spotify deleted several episodes and published new rules telling those uploading content to avoid claiming Covid-19 is a hoax and spreading anti-vaccine misinformation. It also said it would add content advisories to podcast episodes discussing Covid-19. However, the anti-vaccine songs, which contain lyrics in some cases far more extreme than those podcasts, did not carry a content warning. In some cases the algorithm directed listeners to content with low numbers of plays, potentially amplifying the reach of misinformation that would otherwise have had a small audience. Many of the songs had titles containing keywords such as “vaccine” and “mask”, suggesting it would be easy for Spotify to locate them if it wanted to. Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a group that monitors misinformation and harmful content online, said the material identified contained “unscientific, provably false misinformation” that encourages listeners to refuse vaccines that could save lives. He said: “Spotify isn’t just hosting and profiting from dangerous misinformation, its algorithm is proactively connecting disparate pieces of dangerous misinformation and packaging it up to listeners. After the Joe Rogan controversy, much was made of Spotify’s supposed tough stance against Covid misinformation. It appears the opposite is true.” Spotify has previously removed other types of harmful content from its platform that was deemed to breach its policies. In December, following an investigation by Sky News, it removed almost 150 hours of content it said violated its hateful content policy, including antisemitic, racist and white supremacist material found in podcasts. In 2020, a BBC investigation led Spotify and other platforms including Apple Music, YouTube Music and Deezer to remove racist, antisemitic and homophobic content. An excerpt of a Hitler speech, calls for “Aryans” to make a brand new start, and references to white power were found in songs hosted by the streaming services. Don’t Tek Di Vaccine was among the songs Spotify took down this weekend. It is yet to say if it plans to add health warnings to songs which discuss Covid-19, as it has with podcasts. A spokesperson said: “Spotify prohibits content on the platform which promotes dangerous false, or dangerous deceptive content about Covid-19 that may cause offline harm and/or pose a direct threat to public health. When content that violates this standard is identified, the appropriate enforcement action is taken.”","Can’t you see what’s unfolding?” say the lyrics of another, adding: “The whole thing ends once the people have risen.” Spotify this weekend removed several of the songs flagged to it by the Observer, which it said breached rules banning content that promotes “dangerous, false, or deceptive content about Covid-19” that may pose a threat to public health. One user who played a song containing anti-vaccine lyrics was given a personalised playlist directing them to even more extreme songsOf the 50 songs in that playlist, 19 included explicit references to anti-vaccine and Covid misinformation, including claims the vaccine is being used to microchip people. The findings have stoked debate about the streaming giant’s handling of misinformation, with critics calling for the platform – and other streaming services hosting similar material – to be held to the same standard as traditional social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. Several artists including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell demanded their content be removed from Spotify in protest at Rogan’s alleged role in spreading misinformation about Covid-19, and 270 US doctors, scientists, healthcare professionals and professors wrote to the platform calling Rogan “a menace to public health” for airing anti-vaccine ideology.

61,61,"The UK tax department has seized three non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as part of an investigation into a suspected VAT fraud scheme involving 250 fake companies. HM Revenue and Customs said on Monday it had seized the NFTs and arrested three people on suspicion of attempting to defraud it out of £1.4m. It is the first time a UK law enforcement agency has seized an NFT. NFTs are unique digital tokens that first appeared in 2014 and can be bought and sold in crypto or traditional currencies but which have no tangible form of their own. Nick Sharp, HMRC’s deputy director economic crime, said the NFT seizure “serves as a warning to anyone who thinks they can use crypto assets to hide money from HMRC”. He said: “We constantly adapt to new technology to ensure we keep pace with how criminals and evaders look to conceal their assets.” HMRC said it had secured a court order to seize the three digital artwork NFTs, which have not yet been valued, and other crypto assets worth about £5,000. The suspects are alleged to have used “sophisticated methods to try to hide their identities including false and stolen identities”, HMRC said. Jake Moore, an adviser at the cybersecurity firm ESET, said the seizure showed the police are fast adapting to the threat of cybercrime and how to seize digital assets that are designed to avoid law enforcement. “A key element of cryptocurrencies’ design is to keep them secure and protected against interception by anyone, whether that be a threat actor or law enforcement,” Moore said. “But with a fast-moving digital world where mistakes can be made, police forces are beginning to buck the trend in how they investigate digital crime, locate evidence and finally seize digital assets. “Confiscation also comes with a very tempting reward due to the Proceeds of Crime Act where the investigating police force can request to keep half of the forfeited goods and the other half will go to the Home Office. So with digital currencies, this can be extremely appealing indeed.” The market for NFTs grew to an estimated $22bn (£16bn) last year. Data from DappRadar, a firm that tracks sales, showed that trading in NFTs reached $22bn in 2021, compared with $100m in 2020, and that the floor market cap of the top 100 NFTs ever issued – a measure of their collective value – was $16.7bn.","He said: “We constantly adapt to new technology to ensure we keep pace with how criminals and evaders look to conceal their assets.” HMRC said it had secured a court order to seize the three digital artwork NFTs, which have not yet been valued, and other crypto assets worth about £5,000.

62,62,"Google announced on Wednesday that it plans to limit the amount of personal information shared on Android, the world-leading mobile phone operating system used by more than 2.5 billion people around the globe. The shift comes a year after Apple curtailed the amount of personal data shared by users of its mobile operating system – a change that sent shock waves through the digital advertising world and contributed to a collapse in Facebook’s share price. In a blogpost Anthony Chavez, vice-president of product management, Android security and privacy, noted that advertising plays a “key role” in allowing most mobile apps to be free but added that “the industry must continue to evolve how digital advertising works to improve user privacy”. Android’s operating system runs on about 72% of mobile devices worldwide compared with Apple’s rival iOS, which runs on about 26.9% of devices. The change is likely to upend the digital advertising market – limiting the massive amounts of data that app companies collect from their users. But it also comes at a time when Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is coming under ever greater scrutiny from regulators around the world over its dominance of digital advertising. The news is likely to trigger concerns that the Android changes will further cement Alphabet’s dominance in mobile ads. In an apparent swipe at Apple, Chavez said the changes would be made over the next two years and in conjunction with the industry. “We realize that other platforms have taken a different approach to ads privacy, bluntly restricting existing technologies used by developers and advertisers. We believe that – without first providing a privacy-preserving alternative path – such approaches can be ineffective and lead to worse outcomes for user privacy and developer businesses,” wrote Chavez. While the industry may argue over its execution, Apple and soon Google’s privacy policies are one of the few sweeping and US-wide restrictions on how consumer data is collected and used. There are no federal laws regulating the collection and distribution of personal user information. Last year Apple updated its mobile system to force apps to ask for users’ permission in order to track them around the web. The company has long positioned itself as a champion of privacy and its chief executive, Tim Cook, has regularly clashed with Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg over the ethics – and value – of unfettered data sharing. The clash came to a head earlier this month when Zuckerberg blamed Apple’s changes for a disastrous set of earnings that led to a record-setting fall in Facebook owner Meta’s share price.

63,63,"The City watchdog has raised concerns about a deal to give the cryptocurrency platform Binance access to the UK payments network just months after it ordered the company to stop all regulated activities in Britain. The Financial Conduct Authority said it had limited powers to object to the arrangement with Paysafe, a London-based payments provider, despite its concerns about Binance offering complex and high-risk investments to consumers. The FCA had ordered Binance to stop all UK regulated activity last June over worries about weak consumer protections, amid a wider crackdown on the cryptocurrency industry’s potential role in fraud and money laundering. Some of the UK’s largest high street banks, including Santander and Barclays, also took action, barring customers from sending money to the exchange. However, the deal opens up the potential for Binance users to deposit sterling via Paysafe through the Faster Payments Service, the network for sending money between bank accounts operated by Pay.UK, which owns the system. An FCA spokesperson said: “Our concerns about Binance remain. We received a notification of this business partnership but have limited powers to object to arrangements of this kind.” The spokesperson added that Paysafe was “aware of our concerns” about Binance, and said the payments provider was “subject to close ongoing supervision consistent with our approach for firms of its size”. The regulator’s concern was first reported by the Financial Times. Paysafe said it was a reputable payments partner with deep regulatory knowledge and experience. “We take our regulatory obligations extremely seriously and comply with the highest industry standards,” a spokesperson said. “We always adopt a fully transparent approach when dealing with regulators.” Binance issued notices to UK customers in December asking them to provide additional information in order to continue to access high-risk derivatives on the platform. Paysafe will maintain full control of anti-money-laundering and compliance checks based on the information it receives about customers via the exchange. The FCA consumer warning was among the first in a series of global setbacks for Binance, which is one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Regulators in Japan and Hong Kong also ordered restrictions on trade in their financial systems. Binance has no fixed headquarters, instead relying on a network of affiliated organisations that link with financial groups in different countries. Its affiliate in Britain, Binance Markets Ltd, was accused by the FCA of failing to respond to questions about the group in August 2021, making it near impossible to manage. The regulator also issued a consumer warning against Binance Holdings Ltd, which is registered in the Cayman Islands. Binance said it took its compliance obligations “very seriously” and that the firm worked collaboratively with regulators. A spokesperson added: “We have worked hard to build a robust compliance programme that incorporates anti-money-laundering principles and tools used by top financial institutions.”","The City watchdog has raised concerns about a deal to give the cryptocurrency platform Binance access to the UK payments network just months after it ordered the company to stop all regulated activities in Britain.

64,64,"A micrometeorite slamming into a satellite was the likely cause of a seven-hour outage for NBN Co internet users in December, a Senate hearing has been told. About 46,500 of NBN Co’s 112,000 satellite users in regional and remote parts of Australia were left without internet between 8.30pm on 21 December and 3.20am the following morning due to the incident. NBN Co’s chief development officer for regional and remote Australia, Gavin Williams, told a Senate estimates hearing on Tuesday that after an investigation involving the company’s satellite operation partners, the most likely cause of the outage was determined to be a micrometeorite. “It cannot be 100% characterised as this but all the evidence points to a micrometeorite that impacted the satellite,” he said. “It effectively makes [the] satellite’s body rotate while it remains in its orbit. So the satellite is no longer pointing at the appropriate spot on Earth [and] the payload – the transmission system on that satellite – is effectively switched off for that period.” He said the satellite was able to recover itself. “Now that impacted about 46,500 customers. The satellite was able to find Earth again. You know you say ‘it’s not rocket science’, senator? This is rocket science.” The testing to restart the service took around seven hours, meaning customers were left without internet for that period. Williams said that 573 of these customers, however, went two weeks without internet after the incident. He said the NBN boxes in their homes were missing parameters in the configuration file, meaning they could not reconnect to the network, but it took NBN Co a long time to realise the issue. “So it meant that and, frankly, it took us you know, there was a course of action three times a day updates … but it took quite a long time actually to delve into what was wrong and how you could recover,” Williams said. The company had considered pulling staff away from annual leave to go out to each of the nearly 600 premises in regional and remote parts of Australia to try to fix it, but ultimately NBN Co was able to fix the issue remotely. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Williams said those customers who endured two weeks without internet services would be eligible for rebates, and the company had developed emergency patches to rapidly identify and recover services should the issue happen again. He admitted it was “not our finest hour” but said it was the first time such an event had occurred. “This kind of outage deserves the classification of being unprecedented,” he said. The NBN Co CEO, Stephen Rue, said the company would begin offering full fibre upgrades to fibre-to-the-node and fibre-to-the-curb customers in March and May respectively, but admitted the timing of the launch may be affected depending on when the election is called, and what the company’s obligations are during caretaker mode.","So the satellite is no longer pointing at the appropriate spot on Earth [and] the payload – the transmission system on that satellite – is effectively switched off for that period.” He said the satellite was able to recover itself.

65,65,"Environmentalists in Montana called it the “death watch”. Following years of financial losses one of the handful of remaining coal-fired power plants in the state appeared doomed, its likely fate offering a small but noteworthy victory in the effort to avoid disastrous climate change. But then a bitcoin mining company stepped in to resurrect it. The Hardin generating station, a 115-megawatt coal plant located a dozen miles from the historic site of the famous battle of Little Big Horn in southern Montana, was slated for closure in 2018 due to a lack of customers only to somehow limp on, operating on just 46 days in 2020. “We were just waiting for this thing to die,” said Anne Hedges, co-director of the Montana Environmental Information Center. “They were struggling and looking to close. It was on the brink. And then this cryptocurrency company came along.” In a deal struck in late 2020, Marathon, a bitcoin “mining” company, became the sole recipient of the power station’s electricity. It established an elongated data center on 20 acres of land beside the facility that is packed with more than 30,000 Antminer S19 units, a specialized computer that mines for bitcoin. Such thirst for power is common in crypto – globally bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than Norway, a country of 5.3 million people. As the bitcoin miners moved in last year, Hardin roared back to life. In the first nine months of 2021 alone, the plant’s boilers fired up on 236 separate days. Planet-heating emissions from the burning of Hardin’s coal soared too, with 187,000 tons of carbon dioxide emitted in the second quarter of last year, more than 5000% more than was expelled in the same period in 2020. In the third quarter, a further 206,000 tons of CO2 was emitted, a 905% increase on 2020, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data shows. Hardin was operating at “near full capacity”, Marathon said in a December update, with the data center producing around 34 bitcoin on 1 December. “I was horrified to see it all happen, it was a terrible turn of events,” said Hedges, who took to visiting the plant and photographing the new data center as it took shape, fans perched on its roof to help cool the humming computer hardware. “This isn’t helping old ladies from freezing to death, it’s to enrich a few people while destroying our climate for all of us. If you’re concerned about climate change you should have nothing to do with cryptocurrency, it’s a disaster for the climate.” Hardin is part of a wave of America’s “zombie” fossil fuel plants that have been brought back from the dead by cryptocurrency companies looking to feed the insatiable energy demands of their mining operations. China, formerly the epicenter of the bitcoin industry, effectively banished around half of the world’s currency miners last year and the resulting search for cheap power has seen companies eye struggling US power stations. In 2020, a mothballed coal plant in upstate New York was converted to run on gas and power a large-scale bitcoin mining operation, a move that owner Greenidge Generation said is “bringing a piece of the world’s digital future” to the state. Eric Adams, the new New York City mayor who said he would accept his first paycheck in bitcoin, last week criticised the environmental impact of crypto mining. Meanwhile, in western Pennsylvania, thousands of bitcoin mining computers have been packed in shipping containers alongside the Scrubgrass plant, which burns waste coal and was set to close before pivoting to bitcoin. And in Kentucky, a new bitcoin facility is being built next to the Big Rivers Electric Corporation, which owns and operates four coal-fired power plants. This tactic, crypto firms argue, generates local jobs – Kentucky aimed to lure currency miners by passing a law that exempts them from an electricity sales tax – and uses up excess power without straining the grid for homes and businesses. But critics point out that the enormous electricity consumption needed to sustain the virtual currency is fueling the climate crisis and now threatens a partial resurrection of coal in the US. “Coal and natural gas power plants used for crypto mining that would otherwise be sunsetting as we decarbonize adds yet more carbon to the atmosphere in an era when we should be cutting such emissions,” said Benjamin Jones, a specialist in natural resource economics at the University of New Mexico. “Crypto’s continued or expanding use of fossil fuel sourced electricity imposes significant environmental economic costs on society.” Jones said it is “troubling” to see that bitcoin’s already huge energy consumption is increasing and that most of this is coming from fossil fuels, despite some efforts by mining companies to increase the amount of clean energy they use – Marathon, the company that draws power from Hardin, has struck a separate agreement in Texas to take power from a wind farm. Even some early champions of bitcoin have balked at its energy use, with Elon Musk last year halting Tesla’s use of the crypto currency because, he said, the electric vehicle company is “concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel”. Uber, the ride-hailing service, has said it won’t accept crypto payments until the climate impacts are reduced. A little more than a decade ago, it was possible to mine bitcoins with a single computer at home, using a negligible amount of electricity. The ultimate supply of bitcoins was limited and new bitcoins were awarded to those who could help validate transactions – the miners. The process of validation essentially involves playing a giant guessing game that gets more difficult the more miners participate. As interest in bitcoin has soared, fast, powerful computers, packed in warehouses, now have a better chance of winning the guessing game and being rewarded with several bitcoins, which are currently worth around $42,000 each. This race for bitcoin wealth gobbles up an enormous amount of electricity – around 0.5% of total global consumption. The energy used to mine bitcoin every 60 seconds would be enough to power the average American household for 17 years, while the annual electricity consumption for mining would be able to power all kettles used to boil water for tea in the UK for 28 years. While this usage has been criticized by climate activists, bitcoin miners claim it should be put in a different context. Fred Thiel, chief executive of Marathon, said that the movement of physical goods around the world, and even the use of washing machines in the US, uses more energy than bitcoin. “I understand the desire for some people to point bitcoin mining as the big bad boy, but on a comparison with every other industry out there, it’s insignificant,” he said in an interview. Thiel likens bitcoin mining to the transactions processed in data centers by companies such as Amazon and Google and claimed that the industry is moving quickly towards renewable energy – Marathon plans to phase out its use of coal next year – after finding its options were limited when miners had to quickly shift away from China. “Go back to 2020, renewable companies weren’t offering energy to bitcoin miners,” said Thiel. “Very few people wanted to even deal with bitcoin miners in the energy world. And so bitcoin miners spent time looking for stranded assets. And so the only way for us to mine was to find stranded energy, which we did in finding the Hardin plant.” It remains to be seen if bitcoin will make a significant move away from fossil fuels, but in the meantime it will likely come under increasing scrutiny over its appetite for fossil fuel-powered electricity. “We simply don’t know how emissions from bitcoin mining will look in five to 10 years,” said Jones, the University of New Mexico professor. “It seems likely, though, it will to continue to be a major consumer of energy going forward.”","The Hardin generating station, a 115-megawatt coal plant located a dozen miles from the historic site of the famous battle of Little Big Horn in southern Montana, was slated for closure in 2018 due to a lack of customers only to somehow limp on, operating on just 46 days in 2020. “Crypto’s continued or expanding use of fossil fuel sourced electricity imposes significant environmental economic costs on society.” Jones said it is “troubling” to see that bitcoin’s already huge energy consumption is increasing and that most of this is coming from fossil fuels, despite some efforts by mining companies to increase the amount of clean energy they use – Marathon, the company that draws power from Hardin, has struck a separate agreement in Texas to take power from a wind farm.

66,66,"For Black employees at Tesla’s flagship California plant, coming into work could mean being harassed, bullied by a supervisor or finding racist graffiti sprayed on factory walls. That’s according to a new lawsuit filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), which alleges that Black workers in the company’s Fremont factory experienced “rampant racism” that the company left “unchecked for years”. In the suit, filed on 9 February in an Alameda county court in California, the agency says Black workers reported they were subjected to racist slurs and drawings and were assigned the most physically demanding jobs. “Workers referred to the factory as the ‘slaveship’ or ‘the plantation’, where defendants’ production leads ‘crack the whip’,” the agency said in the complaint. “Tesla has continued to deflect and evade responsibility,” the lawsuit adds. “While it claims to not tolerate racial harassment or discrimination at its factories, Tesla’s investigations of complaints are not compliant with law.” Allegations of racial discrimination at Tesla’s US facilities aren’t new. The company has been hit with several discrimination lawsuits from employees over similar allegations in recent years. But filed by a government agency, the new suit may have far wider implications. “When a single worker sues Tesla, the company may be motivated to sweep the allegations under the rug. But here, the potential for actual, systemic change is much greater,” said Veena Dubal, labor law professor at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. Tesla has called the lawsuit “misguided” in a public blog post, noting that it focuses on alleged misconduct that took place between 2015 and 2019, but that in more recent years the DFEH has dismissed dozens of individual discrimination complaints against the company. The company said it does not tolerate harassment and has disciplined and fired workers who engaged in misconduct. “A narrative spun by the DFEH and a handful of plaintiff firms to generate publicity is not factual proof,” Tesla said. The company, which has disbanded its media relations department, did not respond to additional requests for comment. The case is just the latest spat between the carmaker and US regulators. “At a time when manufacturing jobs are leaving California, the DFEH has decided to sue Tesla instead of constructively working with us,” the company said in its blogpost. Earlier this week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk accused federal regulators of unfairly targeting Tesla, saying in a recent filing that the Securities and Exchange Commission has engaged in “outsized efforts” to monitor the company that “seem calculated to chill its exercise” of free speech. The claims The claims center around allegations in Tesla’s Fremont factory in the San Francisco Bay Area. Black workers at the facility were subjected to “offensive racial harassing conduct so severe and pervasive that it created a hostile work environment”, according to the 39-page complaint from DFEH. Many workers reported derogatory comments came directly from their superiors, the agency writes. One Black worker reported hearing racial slurs as often as 50-100 times a day, being called the “N-word”, and “hood rats”, according to the complaint. Other workers told of racist graffiti found in factory common areas, including swastikas, KKK, the N-word, and other racist writing that Tesla did not remove for months at a time, according to the suit. Black workers reported being assigned difficult, menial jobs in segregated areas of the factory known as “the dark side”, DFEH also says, and are less likely to be promoted to management positions. “For many Black workers, the stress from the severe and pervasive racial harassment, the risk of a physical altercation and escalation with harassers, the blatant discrimination, the disproportionately severe discipline, and the futility of complaining, made the working conditions so intolerable that they resigned,” the complaint says. Years of complaints The complaint also alleges Tesla has been ignoring “years of complaints from Black workers”. “These numerous complaints by Black and/or African American workers about racial harassment, racial discrimination, and retaliation lodged over a span of almost a decade have been futile,” the lawsuit reads. A diversity report published by Tesla in December 2020 showed employees identifying as Black and African American make up 10% of its US workforce, but only 4% of employees at director level. Employees who identified as Hispanic and Latino employees make up 22% of the total workforce, but represent only 4% of employees at the director level and above. According to the DFEH complaint, Tesla’s human resources department is “understaffed and inadequately trained”, leading to a failure to address complaints by workers. In 2020, the company had one HR professional for every 740 employees, DFEH said. “One Black worker stated that immediately after she complained about race harassment, [Tesla] human resources official texted her harasser, who was also her supervisor, about her complaint against him,” the complaint says. Lawsuits pile up Last week’s filing is just the latest in a number of discrimination lawsuits to hit what has become the world’s most valuable automaker. A federal jury in October awarded $137m to Owen Diaz, an employee at the Fremont plant in 2015 and 2016 who said managers ignored his complaints about repeated racial harassment including slurs and swastikas scrawled on bathroom walls. A judge in that case is considering Tesla’s bid for a new trial or to lower the award, which is one of the largest in a discrimination lawsuit by a single worker. In December, six female plaintiffs working in plants across the US alleged that they experienced physical assaults, harassment, and catcalling at Tesla facilities. Another female employee made similar claims in a lawsuit filed in November. “The through line for all of these lawsuits is the systemic nature of the harassment and discrimination in Tesla’s workplace,” said attorney David A Lowe, a partner at the firm representing the women. “The extent of the complaints show that it is a widespread, egregious problem – it’s clearly not just a couple of bad apples.” The company is also still fighting a lawsuit filed in 2017 by Marcus Vaughn, yet another employee at the same Fremont factory who alleged he was repeatedly called the “N-word” by managers and co-workers. Vaughn also claims he was fired for “not having a positive attitude” when he brought complaints about the treatment to HR. A judge in 2018 rejected Tesla’s bid to force Vaughn’s case into arbitration. Tesla has also moved to force the recent sexual harassment case into arbitration, a motion that will be ruled on in coming weeks. Tesla has denied wrongdoing in all cases, and has said it has implemented various policies in recent years to prevent racist conduct and punish it when it does occur. “Our company has more than 33,000 employees, with over 10,000 in the Fremont factory alone, so it is not humanly possible to stop all bad conduct, but we will do our best to make it as close to zero as possible,” Tesla said regarding the case filed by Vaughn. Why this is different While DFEH’s suit may not be the first discrimination suit filed against Tesla, it may be the most consequential, said Dubal, the labor law professor. That’s because the agency is not bound by agreements most Tesla employees have signed to bring legal claims in arbitration rather than court. “While an individual suing may be sent to arbitration, the state will not be. This means that this lawsuit can change the alleged pattern and practice of discrimination,” said Dubal. The department can also seek the same kind of relief as workers who file lawsuits, including court orders barring future discrimination and money damages. Such penalties can be significant: in December, gaming company Riot Games agreed to pay $100m to settle a sex discrimination lawsuit by the agency. Tesla is accused of violating the Fair Employment and Housing Act and the California Equal Pay Act, and could face fines of millions of dollars in addition to enforced changes to internal policies. The company may also be required to provide back pay to employees who say they were unfairly compensated for their work due to discrimination. The odds do not look good for Tesla, said Dubal. State agencies have “limited resources” and typically only take on cases where “there is very clear evidence” of wrongdoing and they are “very likely to win”, she said. “There are many issues with racial discrimination in Silicon Valley – from executive suites to the factory workers,” she said. “This shows state enforcement agencies are listening to what people are experiencing and going after these companies.” Reuters contributed to this report.","“Workers referred to the factory as the ‘slaveship’ or ‘the plantation’, where defendants’ production leads ‘crack the whip’,” the agency said in the complaint. “For many Black workers, the stress from the severe and pervasive racial harassment, the risk of a physical altercation and escalation with harassers, the blatant discrimination, the disproportionately severe discipline, and the futility of complaining, made the working conditions so intolerable that they resigned,” the complaint says. “The through line for all of these lawsuits is the systemic nature of the harassment and discrimination in Tesla’s workplace,” said attorney David A Lowe, a partner at the firm representing the women. “The extent of the complaints show that it is a widespread, egregious problem – it’s clearly not just a couple of bad apples.” The company is also still fighting a lawsuit filed in 2017 by Marcus Vaughn, yet another employee at the same Fremont factory who alleged he was repeatedly called the “N-word” by managers and co-workers. ","But filed by a government agency, the new suit may have far wider implications. “For many Black workers, the stress from the severe and pervasive racial harassment, the risk of a physical altercation and escalation with harassers, the blatant discrimination, the disproportionately severe discipline, and the futility of complaining, made the working conditions so intolerable that they resigned,” the complaint says. “These numerous complaints by Black and/or African American workers about racial harassment, racial discrimination, and retaliation lodged over a span of almost a decade have been futile,” the lawsuit reads. This means that this lawsuit can change the alleged pattern and practice of discrimination,” said Dubal. ","lawsuit filed by California's department of fair employment and housing. it alleges that Black workers in the company's Fremont factory experienced ""rampant racism"" the agency says Black workers were subjected to racist slurs and drawings. Tesla has called the lawsuit ""misguided"" in a public blog post","The electric car company Tesla has been accused by a government agency of failing to properly investigate claims of racial discrimination at its Tesla is being sued by the state of California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) has filed a discrimination lawsuit against Tesla,"
67,67,"A North Carolina motorcyclist is suing Amazon for $100m after a collision with a delivery driver resulted in the amputation of his left leg. The man says Amazon’s pressure on its employees rendered the driver distracted and caused the crash. The accident happened in October when motorcyclist Justin Hartley was hit by a Hertz truck with an Amazon logo in Virginia Beach. According to the lawsuit, the driver, Christopher Gill, admitted after the crash that he had his eyes on directions on his GPS, provided by Amazon, the Virginian-Pilot reported. The accident left Hartley gravely injured: it fractured his left wrist and he had to have his left knee amputated. “The unrealistic expectations that are put on the drivers are fueling these negligence cases,” said Kevin Biniazan, the attorney representing Hartley. “The driver was so entranced in making his delivery that he did not see our client.” Biniazan said the accident was “preventable”, and the lawsuit places the blame on the Amazon itself, deepening allegations of harsh working conditions for Amazon workers that have dogged the company for years. Delivery drivers have shared horror stories, including working 14-hour shifts and having to urinate in plastic bottles instead of going to the bathroom due to the intense demands of the job. Recently, Amazon workers at an Alabama warehouse won the chance to vote for a union a second time, after Amazon was found guilty of violating labor law during the first election. According to Hartley’s lawsuit, drivers are made to use a “Flex”, app, which dictates which directions the drivers should take and when to take bathroom or lunch breaks. If the driver is running behind, they are given reminders that they are “behind the rabbit” and have to be “rescued”. If a driver is “behind the rabbit” or requires “rescue” often enough, it can negatively affect their pay. The nature of this app can create “foreseeable risk that Amazon drivers will be distracted while operating their vehicles, resulting in a hazardous condition,” the lawsuit claimed, according to the Virginian-Pilot. Amazon has denied all allegations, saying in a statement to the Associated Press that the lawsuit failed to “implicate a legal or contractual responsibility owed on behalf of Amazon”. The company also denied Gill had committed “any act of negligence”. Gill responded to the lawsuit by denying that he initially admitted to authorities that he had been looking at the GPS, according to the Virginian Pilot. The paper also reported his lawyers plan to argue that the accident was the result of Hartley being “contributorily negligent” and “assum[ing] the risk of his actions and fail[ing] to mitigate his damages”. Amazon did not immediately respond to a Guardian request for further.

68,68,"Airbnb has said it will offer free, temporary housing for up to 100,000 refugees from Ukraine, joining a swathe of companies offering support and donations following the Russian invasion. The home rentals platform’s nonprofit set up to provide housing relief during international crises, Airbnb.org, will partner with resettlement agencies to house Ukrainian refugees across the world. The cost of the stays will be covered by Airbnb, donors to its refugee fund and hosts offering discounted or free accommodation. “We know that hosts on Airbnb and guests around the world will be eager to stand up and assist this massive effort and in the coming days, Airbnb plans to share details on how hosts on Airbnb and the broader community can support this initiative,” it said. Other companies are channelling their support by donating millions of pounds to charities helping those hit hardest by the Ukraine crisis. The jeweller Pandora has donated more than $1m (£746,000) to the UN’s children’s agency Unicef, while the shoe chain Kurt Geiger has given £50,000 to the British Red Cross, which is working with the Ukrainian Red Cross Society to provide food, water, medical supplies, clothes and shelter to those caught in the conflict. Neil Clifford, CEO of Kurt Geiger, said: “This is a situation of human suffering and we believe we have a moral obligation to reach out and help in any way we can. In light of this human crisis, we will be donating 100% of last week’s Kurt Geiger store profits.” Ukraine has received a surge in donations from companies and huge sums have flowed into the country in the last 24 hours. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is donating $10m to aid humanitarian efforts. It will also freeze the accounts of Russian clients targeted by sanctions, after Ukraine’s vice prime minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, called on major digital currency platforms to block crypto transactions among all Russian users. “We’re blocking accounts of those on the sanctions list (if they have Binance accounts) and ensuring that all sanctions are met in full,” a spokesperson for the company told Reuters on Monday, declining to give further details. Anonymous bitcoin donors have committed at least $13.7m to the Ukrainian war effort, according to cryptocurrency analysts, as an alternative to donations through traditional crowdfunding and payments companies – some of which ban payments to groups supporting the Ukrainian military. Elliptic, a blockchain analysis company, says the Ukrainian government, NGOs and volunteers have gathered the funds by advertising their bitcoin wallet addresses online. Gaming companies have joined the crowdfunding surge and the Polish developer 11 Bit Studios announced it would donate the profits made from its anti-war PC game, This War of Mine, in the next week to the Ukrainian Red Cross. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has forced nearly 400,000 people to flee their homes in Ukraine, according to the UN refugee agency. More than 4.5 million more could follow if the fighting spreads, Ukrainian authorities have said. The number of civilians killed has risen to at least 352, Ukraine’s interior ministry has said.","“We know that hosts on Airbnb and guests around the world will be eager to stand up and assist this massive effort and in the coming days, Airbnb plans to share details on how hosts on Airbnb and the broader community can support this initiative,” it said.

69,69,"It is not the place for cryptocurrency exchanges to block transactions by Russian users, the founder of one of the largest trading platforms has said, amid concern that digital currencies will be used to bypass sanctions. The chief executive and founder of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, said the company was “not in a position to sanction, like, populations of people”. “There are a few hundred individuals that are on the international sanctions list in Russia, mostly politicians, and we follow that very, very strictly,” Zhao told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We differentiate between the Russian politicians who start wars and the normal people, many normal Russians do not agree with war.” He added: “We are not political, we are against war, but we are here to help the people.” Cryptocurrency exchanges – which enable the trade of digital currencies including bitcoin and ethereum – and have been coming under pressure to comply with western sanctions, by blocking transactions with Russia, amid fears that crypto could allow the Kremlin to bypass restrictions designed to cut it off from the international banking system. The UK, EU, US and Canada moved at the weekend to expel Russian banks from Swift, the main global payments messaging system used by banks, and have also sought to prevent Russia’s central bank from using its foreign currency reserves. Some now fear that the Russian government and its banks could aim to use crypto as a backdoor, as an alternative measure of international exchange to the dollar. Zhao, known as “CZ”, said he did not know how many of the platform’s accounts had been frozen as a result of links with Russia but insisted that Binance knows its customers and would not allow sanctioned individuals to use its services. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister has called on crypto exchanges to block the addresses of all Russian users, a plea which has so far been resisted by the largest exchanges including Binance and Nasdaq-listed Coinbase. “The right level of sanctions is not a debate with us. We don’t make sanction lists,” Zhao said. “There are tens of thousands of exchanges globally. Many of them are very small, many of them are less secure. Many of them are less compliant. We don’t control the industry. I can publish my sanction list, you can publish yours, guess what? No one else is going to follow it. It just moves Russian users to other smaller platforms.” Zhao said he did not believe that cryptocurrencies – which are held on a decentralised ledger – would enable people to dodge sanctions. “If people want to evade sanctions, there’s always multiple methods. You can avoid sanctions using US dollars, using cash, using diamonds, using gold. I don’t think crypto is anything special there.” Zhao, whose personal wealth has been estimated at $1.9bn (£1bn) by Forbes magazine’s billionaires list, said Binance had donated $10m to aid the humanitarian effort in Ukraine and help those fleeing the conflict.","It is not the place for cryptocurrency exchanges to block transactions by Russian users, the founder of one of the largest trading platforms has said, amid concern that digital currencies will be used to bypass sanctions. “We differentiate between the Russian politicians who start wars and the normal people, many normal Russians do not agree with war.” He added: “We are not political, we are against war, but we are here to help the people.” Cryptocurrency exchanges – which enable the trade of digital currencies including bitcoin and ethereum – and have been coming under pressure to comply with western sanctions, by blocking transactions with Russia, amid fears that crypto could allow the Kremlin to bypass restrictions designed to cut it off from the international banking system.

70,70,"YouTube announced on Friday that it had begun blocking access globally to channels associated with Russian state-funded media, citing a policy barring content that denies, minimizes or trivializes well-documented violent events. The video platform had previously blocked the channels, specifically those of Russia Today and Sputnik, across Europe. YouTube announced the move in a Twitter post and said that while the change was effective immediately, “we expect our systems to take time to ramp up”. The platform, which is owned by Google, said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine now fell under its violent events policy and violating material would be removed. A YouTube spokesman, Farshad Shadloo, said the blocking of the Russian outlets was in line with that policy. YouTube also said it was now removing content about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that violates its policy on material that “minimizes or trivializes well-documented violent events”. The Kremlin refers to the invasion as a “special military operation” and not a war. YouTube previously paused YouTube ads in Russia. Now, it is extending that to all the ways it makes money on the platform in Russia. Russian state media have called restrictions placed on them by distributors, which include app stores and other social media services, unjustified censorship. “The blocking by YouTube is nothing but a new turn of an atrocious attack on one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society – that is freedom of the press,” Sputnik said in a statement on Friday. YouTube declined to specify which and how many channels had been blocked globally, or whether they ever would be restored. Workers across Google had been urging YouTube to take additional punitive measures against Russian channels, accusing them of spreading false narratives about the Ukrainian leadership and civilian deaths during the war, according to three employees at the company. The move comes as Russia has taken up an increasingly aggressive stance against US tech companies that have taken measures to curb Russian disinformation on their platforms. Russia on Friday moved to block Instagram after its parent company, Meta, said it would allow calls for violence against Vladimir Putin and Russian soldiers involved in the invasion of Ukraine to appear on the social media platform in Ukraine. The Russian government blocked access to Facebook last week. The blocks further limit most Russians’ access to outside information on the war.","YouTube announced the move in a Twitter post and said that while the change was effective immediately, “we expect our systems to take time to ramp up”. “The blocking by YouTube is nothing but a new turn of an atrocious attack on one of the fundamental principles of a democratic society – that is freedom of the press,” Sputnik said in a statement on Friday.

71,71,"Apple’s cut-price iPhone is back and has been upgraded for 2022, with a faster chip and 5G making it an even better bargain than before. The third-generation iPhone SE costs £419 ($429/A$719) and is the cheapest smartphone Apple sells, priced to compete with myriad mid-range Android devices. On the face of it, the iPhone SE doesn’t look that tempting a proposition. There are cheaper smartphones available and it only comes with 64GB of storage. The 4.7in LCD display is bright, but cramped and markedly less crisp and vibrant than competitors. It is basically the same as the previous version from 2020 on the outside, which already looked extremely dated. But while the phone may look decidedly old school on the outside, internally it is anything but. It has Apple’s latest A15 chip, which is the fastest on the block and the same one in the top of the line iPhone 13 Pro. The phone is extremely responsive in use and will continue to be so for years. It runs the latest version of iOS and all the apps and games you might want, except Fortnite. It has 5G, wifi 6, Bluetooth 5, wireless charging, water resistance and all the things you’d expect of a modern phone in 2022. Battery life is average for a modern smartphone, lasting in the region of 30 hours between charges with the screen on for about four hours using various messaging services and apps, and two hours of 5G. That’s a couple of hours longer than its predecessor but miles behind the 46-hour iPhone 13. Use more 4G or 5G mobile data than wifi and battery life will be shorter but the iPhone SE should generally last about a day of use as long as you’re not gaming for long sessions. Specifications Screen: 4.7in Retina HD (LCD) (326ppi) Processor: Apple A15 Bionic RAM: 4GB Storage: 64, 128 or 256GB Operating system: iOS 15.4 Camera: 12MP rear camera with OIS, 7MP front-facing camera Connectivity: 5G, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5, Lightning, and GPS Water resistance: IP67 (1m up to 30 minutes) Dimensions: 138.4 x 67.3 x 7.3mm Weight: 144g Camera The iPhone SE has a single 12-megapixel camera on its back. It produces very good images in decent light with good colour balance, detail and dynamic range. Even in dull indoor settings it does admirably, but it lacks Apple’s night mode so images shot in the evening are dark and grainy by comparison. It shoots solid video too, particularly at this price point, while its selfie camera is similarly decent in good light but weak at night. Sustainability Apple does not provide an expected lifespan for the iPhone SE’s battery but it can be replaced for £49. You should expect it to maintain at least 80% of its original capacity for 500 full charge cycles. Out-of-warranty screen replacements cost £146.44. The previous iPhone SE 2020 was awarded six out of 10 for repairability by the specialists iFixit. The phone contains 91% recycled rare earth metals, 100% recycled tungsten and at least 35% recycled plastic in various components, plus 100% recycled tin in the solder of its main board. The company breaks down the phone’s environmental impact in its report. Apple also offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. Price The Apple iPhone SE 2022 costs from £419 ($429/A$719) with 64GB of storage, £469 ($479/A$799) with 128GB or £569 ($579/A$969) with 256GB. For comparison, the iPhone 13 mini costs £679, the iPhone 13 costs £779, the OnePlus Nord 2 costs £369, the Samsung Galaxy A53 costs £399, the Fairphone 4 costs £499 and the Google Pixel 6 costs £599. Verdict The iPhone SE is one of the best bargains in modern smartphones. It is not the flashiest or most feature-rich but it offers more bang for buck for longer than any other. It has an almost vintage design, lacks the MagSafe charging and accessory system, Face ID and other niceties of Apple’s more expensive models, but is otherwise a solid phone. At £419 it is Apple’s cheapest model, competing with mid-range devices from Samsung and myriad Chinese phone companies, many of which offer bigger, better screens, more cameras and greater storage. But unlike its rivals, it has Apple’s top chip, 5G, the latest version of iOS and will, crucially, be supported for a very long time with software and security updates – it should be safe to use for seven years or more. When even the best competition at this price tops out at only four years of updates, the iPhone SE will last longer than any other mid-range phone. And because it is an iPhone, it benefits from a huge ecosystem of third-party accessories, plus you can get it fixed if you break it and the battery can be replaced when it wears out. The starting 64GB of storage will be enough if you store your photos in the cloud and don’t download lots of games and movies. That makes the iPhone SE the best new smartphone for people who don’t really care about phones – it gets the job done and will last as long as possible. Pros: lowest-cost new iPhone, about seven years of software support, A15 chip, 5G, wireless charging, decent single-lens camera, top performance, easy to handle, water resistance, Touch ID, amazing value. Cons: battery life could be better, no headphone socket, no zoom camera, no Face ID, dated design, very slow charging, no MagSafe.

72,72,"The final version of the UK’s online safety bill, which was presented before parliament last week is likely to face a fair few amendments as it passes through the legislative process. But the legislative draft gives us our first real look beyond the government’s spin at what aspects of UK law are about to change. The bill places a duty of care on tech firms to protect users from harmful content. That duty of care is broadly split into three parts: to limit the spread of illegal content such as child sexual abuse images, terrorist material and that encouraging suicide; ensuring children are not exposed to harmful or inappropriate content; and, for the big platforms like Facebook, Twitter and TikTok, protecting adults from legal but harmful content (such as cyberbullying and eating disorder-related material). The legislation will be overseen by Ofcom, the communications regulator, which will have the power to impose fines of £18m or 10% of a company’s global turnover for breaches of the act. In extreme cases, it can also block websites or apps. Here is a quick precis of the bill, which is expected to become law by the end of the year. Illegal content The bill applies to companies that host user-generated content (so that’s everything from tweets to gym sessions on YouTube) and it requires every organisation within its scope to have in place systems and processes that take down illegal content as soon as they see it. There is also a list of “priority” harms that must be tackled proactively so users don’t get to view them. Those harms include money laundering and human trafficking (alongside the terrorist and child sexual abuse content). The bill also applies to search engines like Google. Legal but harmful content This is the most controversial element of the bill. Removing “legal but harmful” – nasty but not criminal – content is a duty that applies to so-called “category 1” services, which are the big hitters like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok. The legal but harmful clause has alarmed civil liberties campaigners who warn that it will be a censors’ charter: content that resides in a grey area, like satire, could be subject to widespread takedowns. The bill requires that category 1 companies carry out risk assessments detailing the legal but harmful content that could appear on their services (abuse of footballers on Twitter; Russian disinformation on Facebook). They will then have to set out how they will deal with it in their terms and conditions, and state whether they intend to limit, remove or allow that sort of content. So, as a user, you know what you’re in for when you log on. But politicians are also going to have a say on what is unacceptable. These are the priority categories of legal but harmful content. Companies must state clearly what their policy is on these areas in their terms and conditions. These categories will be outlined in secondary legislation and subject to approval by both houses of parliament. In its press release announcing the bill, the government referred to “self-harm, harassment and eating disorders” as being the types of content that platforms will have to tackle. Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, says this will take away the power of censorship from tech execs (it just ends up with the government instead). Child protection The child-protecting elements of the bill have been talked up strongly by Dorries, underpinned by the duty of care. The measures include requiring pornography sites to carry out age checks, which privacy campaigners fear could create a database of the nation’s sexual habits, or even become a backdoor to digital ID system for accessing the internet. However, supporters of the measure argue that the impact of watching pornography on teenagers is such that action has to be taken. Companies will also be required to report to the National Crime Agency any child sexual exploitation and abuse content they detect on their platforms. But the reporting requirement goes further than many are comfortable with: the bill contains provisions that could be used to require companies to actively monitor private chats for such content. And those provisions contain no exception for messages, such as those on WhatsApp, that are “end-to-end encrypted”, meaning the platform cannot see their contents. Critics fear the rules could be an effective ban on the technology, ending a five-year battle from the government. Freedom of press and expression Under the terms of the bill, “news publisher” content has protections, as does “journalistic” content. News websites such as the Guardian, BBC and MailOnline are not covered by the bill (so do not have to follow its guidelines) while below-the-line comments are protected, as well as news content re-posted on social media platforms. The wording of the bill doesn’t give news content a free pass, however. For instance, the bill requires tech firms to “ensure that the importance of the free expression of content of democratic importance is taken into account” when making decisions about “how to treat such content (especially decisions about whether to take it down or restrict users’ access to it)”. The same wording is used for journalistic content and implies that content takedowns could still happen. The press release accompanying the bill appears to acknowledge concern among news publishers about the extent of these protections, stating that: “Ministers will also continue to consider how to ensure platforms do not remove content from recognised media outlets.” Dorries has said she intends to introduce amendments to the bill ensuring that news publisher and journalistic content cannot be taken down until an appeal against a removal decision has taken place. Criminal charges The government has reduced a grace period for UK-wide criminal measures against tech execs by 22 months to just two months (ie there was going to be two year wait, from the moment the bill became law, before the offences were introduced). Tech execs will face up to two years if: they hamper an Ofcom investigation by failing to provide information in an “accurate and timely manner”; tamper with information being sought by Ofcom; obstruct an Ofcom audit or inspection, or provide false information, or if they provide false information at an interview. Companies can also be prosecuted under the last three of those of offences. There are also additional criminal offences for users in England and Wales: cyberflashing (sending an unsolicited sexual image); sending or posting a message that conveys a threat of serious harm; sending a communication with the intent of causing psychological harm or serious emotional distress (this covers Twitter pile-ons); and deliberately sending a false message with the intention of causing harm (deliberately pushing harmful and ineffective Covid treatments). If you want to read the complete version of the newsletter please subscribe to receive TechScape in your inbox every Wednesday. This article was amended shortly after publication to make clear the requirements on companies around legal but harmful content.","That duty of care is broadly split into three parts: to limit the spread of illegal content such as child sexual abuse images, terrorist material and that encouraging suicide; ensuring children are not exposed to harmful or inappropriate content; and, for the big platforms like Facebook, Twitter and TikTok, protecting adults from legal but harmful content (such as cyberbullying and eating disorder-related material). The legislation will be overseen by Ofcom, the communications regulator, which will have the power to impose fines of £18m or 10% of a company’s global turnover for breaches of the act. For instance, the bill requires tech firms to “ensure that the importance of the free expression of content of democratic importance is taken into account” when making decisions about “how to treat such content (especially decisions about whether to take it down or restrict users’ access to it)”.

73,73,"If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a gif is worth millions. The image file format has been a defining element of internet culture for decades, with glass-raising DiCaprios and mic-dropping Obamas facilitating self-expression in a faceless digital world. And we have one man to thank for all the jokes, snark and praise: Stephen Wilhite, inventor of the gif, who died last week, aged 74. Wilhite, who lived in Milford, Ohio, contracted Covid two weeks before his death, his wife, Kathaleen Wilhite, told NPR. A lifelong coder, Stephen Wilhite created the gif in 1987 while working at CompuServe. The compressed image files were useful at a time when internet connections dragged. “If you want lossless, compressed graphics, there is nothing better than gif,” said Sandy Trevor, who managed Wilhite’s team, to the Daily Dot in 2012. Wilhite “invented gif all by himself – he actually did that at home and brought it into work after he perfected it”, said Kathaleen Wilhite to the Verge. “He would figure out everything privately in his head and then go to town programming it on the computer.” It was his proudest achievement, she said. The same year, an update led to animated graphics. “I think the first gif was a picture of a plane. It was a long time ago,” Stephen Wilhite told the Daily Dot in 2012. Indeed, according to Giphy, the go-to site for gif seekers, it was this image: Wilhite worked for Compuserve until 2001, after he had a stroke. Meanwhile, gifs’ popularity took off, including on early social media sites such as MySpace. By 1996, the “dancing baby” image – one of Wilhite’s favorites, he told the New York Times – was plastered across the the web and attached to emails. In 2012, “gif” was dubbed word of the year by Oxford American Dictionaries. The next year, the New York Times called the format “the aesthetic calling card of modern Internet culture”. That year, Wilhite received a Webby lifetime achievement award. Called to the stage, he maintained a poker face as he delivered an acceptance “speech” in an appropriate format: Wilhite continued to code for the rest of his life. He was also passionate about model trains, Kathaleen Wilhite told NPR, and the couple were avid campers; he “loved travelling”, his obituary says. Beyond his work and his hobbies, “he was probably one of the kindest, humble men you’ve ever met,” Kathaleen Wilhite told the radio network. “People loved him and respected his work, and that would mean more to him than anything is how they respected what he did … I miss him more than anyone could imagine.” Tributes poured in on his obituary page. “You changed the way we converse as a society, and immortalized countless moments that would otherwise be fleeting,” wrote one well-wisher. “Thank you for helping the modern world take shape,” wrote another. Giphy offered a tribute of its own, hailing “the simplicity of the format, the power of the looping image. We are indebted to the creativity and vision of Mr Wilhite.” For those who’d like to honor Wilhite’s memory themselves, there are plenty of gifs that pay tribute to their inventor. Perhaps even better, you can heed his unequivocal advice: pronounce it “jif”.","By 1996, the “dancing baby” image – one of Wilhite’s favorites, he told the New York Times – was plastered across the the web and attached to emails.

74,74,"A four-legged robot called Spot has been deployed to wander around the ruins of ancient Pompeii, identifying structural and safety issues while delving underground to inspect tunnels dug by relic thieves. The dog-like robot is the latest in a series of technologies used as part of a broader project to better manage the archaeological park since 2013, when Unesco threatened to add Pompeii to a list of world heritage sites in peril unless Italian authorities improved its preservation. Spot, made by the US-based Boston Dynamics, is capable of inspecting even the smallest of spaces while “gathering and recording data useful for the study and planning of interventions”, park authorities said. The aim, they added, is to “improve both the quality of monitoring of the existing areas, and to further our knowledge of the state of progress of the works in areas undergoing recovery or restoration, and thereby to manage the safety of the site, as well as that of workers.” Until Spot came along, no technology of its kind had been developed for archaeological sites, according to Gabriel Zuchtriegel, the director of Pompeii archaeological park. Park authorities have also experimented with a flying laser scanner capable of conducting 3D scans across the 66-hectare (163-acre) site. Zuchtriegel said: “Technological advances in the world of robotics, in the form of artificial intelligence and autonomous systems, have produced solutions and innovations typically associated with the industrial and manufacturing world, but which until now had not found an application within archaeological sites due to the heterogeneity of environmental conditions, and the size of the site.” Spot will also be tested for use in underground tunnels made by tombaroli, or tomb raiders, who for years made a fortune by digging their way into the ruins and stealing relics to sell on to art traffickers around the world. The thieves have been less successful since 2012, when Italy’s art police intensified a crackdown on culture crime, although tunnels are still being found in the area around Pompeii. “Often the safety conditions within the tunnels dug by grave robbers are extremely precarious, and so the use of a robot could signify a breakthrough that would allow us to proceed with greater speed and in total safety,” said Zuchtriegel.","The dog-like robot is the latest in a series of technologies used as part of a broader project to better manage the archaeological park since 2013, when Unesco threatened to add Pompeii to a list of world heritage sites in peril unless Italian authorities improved its preservation.

75,75,"Chinese telecoms company Huawei has reported a decrease in sales but record profit for 2021, as its top executive, Meng Wanzhou, made her first public appearance since being released from Canadian custody last autumn. The Shenzhen-based company said on Monday its net profits surged 75.9% year on year to 113.7bn yuan (£13.6bn), despite US sanctions. But its revenue skidded 29% to 636.8bn yuan, in line with Huawei’s previous forecast in December. Over the past decade, Huawei rose to become the symbol of China’s growing technological prowess. When the US-China trade and technology rivalry intensified in 2018, the company was caught in the crosshairs. Former US president Donald Trump had moved to cripple Huawei over security and espionage concerns. Meng was arrested in Canada in 2018 at the request of the US after being accused of lying to banks in Hong Kong about Huawei’s dealings with Iran. The Chinese authorities, in return, arrested two Canadians. Both were freed as Meng went home last year. State media hailed it as a diplomatic victory for China. The tech firm attributes its profitability to “improved product portfolios and more efficient internal operations”. It also said its HarmonyOS was used in more than 220m Huawei devices as of 2021, “becoming the world’s fastest growing mobile device operating system”. Huawei is not a publicly listed company, so its accounts are not subject to the same level of audit as companies traded on the stock market. Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Meng, the company’s chief financial officer and the daughter of Huawei’s founder, Ren Zhengfei, said despite a revenue decline in the past year, the company’s ability to make a profit and generate cashflows was increasing. It was also more capable of dealing with uncertainty, she added. Meng acknowledged the challenges sanctions have brought to her company. “The multiple rounds of sanctions imposed by the US have significantly affected our business, especially smartphones and PCs,” she said. Huawei logged 243bn yuan in consumer business sales – almost 50% down from 2020. Despite this, the company appeared to be determined that the only way forward is to double down on its investments in research and development. Huawei spent 142.7bn yuan last year on R&amp;D, which was about 22.4% of its total revenue. Guo Ping, Huawei’s rotating chairman, said the company would continue to attract “world-class talent” and double down on its partnerships with top universities around the world to set up joint labs, despite increased level of scrutiny in the west. “Our fight to survive is not over yet,” he said. “No matter what comes our way, we will keep investing. That is the only way forward.” One of the most imminent uncertainties the company must face is the future of its presence in Russia. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine yet again put Chinese companies under the international scrutiny as western businesses, including McDonald’s, pulled out of the market. “Some countries have come up with policies [vis-a-vis Russia], but they are complex and constantly changing,” said Guo, referring to Russian sanctions, adding: “We are carefully evaluating them.” He added that Huawei had no plan to promote HarmonyOS in Russia for the time being.","Meng was arrested in Canada in 2018 at the request of the US after being accused of lying to banks in Hong Kong about Huawei’s dealings with Iran.

76,76,"British toddlers are increasingly likely to be users of TikTok, with a substantial number of parents saying their preschool children use the video service despite the app supposedly being restricted to those aged 13 and older. About 16% of three- and four-year-olds view TikTok content, according to research commissioned by media regulator Ofcom. This rises to a third of all children in the five- to seven-year-old age group. TikTok’s terms of service excludes under-13s and its moderators have instructions to look out for content produced by younger users and to block their accounts. However, the research suggests the age checks on new users are being widely flouted. The reality that young children – often aided by parents creating profiles or sharing their mobile phone – are accessing TikTok could cause regulatory headaches for the company. Its powerful recommendation algorithm has helped it grow into one of the most powerful media platforms in the world, but it is undergoing the same growing pains that have affected platforms such as Facebook and YouTube, with concerns about content covering topics such as eating disorders and adult material. Since it began being enforced last year, the UK’s age-appropriate design code has required British apps and websites with large numbers of child users to pay particular attention to the personal data they are gathering on young users and to provide a higher level of privacy by default. But the code has no specific restrictions for very young children. A TikTok spokesperson said: “Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our community, especially young people. TikTok is strictly a 13-plus platform and we have processes in place to enforce our minimum age requirements, both at the point of sign up and through the continuous proactive removal of suspected underage accounts from the platform.” Ofcom’s annual survey of the nation’s media habits also suggested the growing popularity of short-form content could be linked to multiscreening, with more children reporting difficulties in focusing on a single online activity. Children reported being unable to watch films, or other long-form content, without being on multiple devices at the same time. Only 4% of children aged three to 17 said they never do anything else while watching television. The number of British households without access to the internet has remained at about 1.7m – equivalent to 6% of British homes. The vast majority in this category are older people or those on the lowest incomes, with most saying they have no plans to go online in the next year – even though that increasingly leaves them cut off from many services and forms of communication. There are also signs that Britons are less tolerant of online anonymity and more concerned that something they posted online could come back to haunt them later in life. Ofcom found that 55% of Britons now disagree with the idea that people should be able to say whatever they want online, even if hurtful or controversial, up from 47% in 2020.","British toddlers are increasingly likely to be users of TikTok, with a substantial number of parents saying their preschool children use the video service despite the app supposedly being restricted to those aged 13 and older.

77,77,"Facebook will restore a banned advert promoting an opinion piece calling for renters rights, after the company’s automated systems blocked the post for “discrimination”. But critics say the error will be repeated unless Facebook acts to protect campaigners on its platform. On Monday Ronan Burtenshaw, the editor of Tribune Magazine, received a message from Facebook saying one of his publication’s posts had been blocked from being promoted on the site. The story, headlined The Rent is Too Damn High, calls for “a struggle of renters against the rentiers” and concludes that solving the housing crisis requires a massive programme of council house creation. Burtenshaw found it had been banned from being shared as a promoted post because the “ad doesn’t comply with our policy on discriminatory practices”. His first conclusion was that the company was trying to protect landlords from discrimination. After Burtenshaw’s tweet went viral and the Guardian queried its removal, Facebook changed course and restored the ad. “The ad placed by the Tribune was rejected in error by our systems but is now active and will appear in the ad library shortly,” a Facebook spokesperson said. “While our review is largely automated, we rely on our teams to build and train these systems, and in some cases to manually review ads. Sometimes both machines and humans make mistakes and an ad may be rejected in error, but we endeavour to restore them as soon as possible.” But Tribune’s post isn’t the only call for better housing policy to have been blocked from the social network. Others, including Martin Lennon, a Labour councillor , have experienced the same issue. His campaigns to build more council housing in Scotland were also blocked for discriminatory practices. The problem seems to lie with Facebook’s attempts to prevent discrimination in adverts for rentals. In 2019 the company was charged with violating the US Fair Housing Act. It was alleged that its targeted advertising allowed landlords to discriminate on the basis of race, colour, national origin, religion, familial status, sex and disability. As a result, Burtenshaw says, Facebook has gone too far in the opposite direction. “Facebook’s policies have accidentally banned campaigning for tenant’s rights on Facebook. It seems like anything that’s targeted by age or region that’s related to housing is something that they’re flagging up – but the effect of it is that if we do a piece on tenant organising, that gets flagged and can’t be advertised. “Given that Facebook’s whole algorithm is written to massively advantage people who put money into the system, it means you can’t get your message across.”","The story, headlined The Rent is Too Damn High, calls for “a struggle of renters against the rentiers” and concludes that solving the housing crisis requires a massive programme of council house creation. “The ad placed by the Tribune was rejected in error by our systems but is now active and will appear in the ad library shortly,” a Facebook spokesperson said.

78,78,"Thousands of Etsy sellers are shutting up shop this week to protest against a rise in fees made by the online marketplace for independent artists, vintage sellers and craftspeople. The move is a response to Etsy, which hosts more than 5.3m businesses, from Monday increasing the fees it charges sellers from 5% to 6.5% – a 30% increase. More than 20,000 Etsy sellers have joined the strike after organising via Reddit, with many putting their online shops in to “vacation mode” for the whole week and some just for Monday. Other Etsy vendors are keeping their stores open but have added imagery explaining their opposition to the fee hike to customers. In a letter sent on Monday to Etsy’s chief executive, Josh Silverman, the strike organiser, Kristi Cassidy from Rhode Island, called the move “nothing short of pandemic profiteering”. Etsy has yet to respond. Speaking to the Guardian, Cassidy said: “We gave people multiple options for how to participate, depending on their financial situation.” Cassidy said more than 22,500 Etsy sellers had joined the protest. As well as anger about the increased fees, Etsy vendors are also opposing other changes, which they argue have cheapened the brand and eaten into their profits. Sellers with an Etsy turnover of more than $10,000 a year are charged an extra mandatory 12% fee for offsite marketing. Noemie Kenyon, a British seller, said: “I’m unhappy about the forced marketing – or what they call ‘offsite ads’. I find that quite outrageous as the seller doesn’t have a say on what will be advertised.” As well as asking for the fee increase to be cancelled, the strike organisers want sellers to be able to opt out of offsite ads. Etsy dropped its B-corp certification – a US legal designation under which companies undertake to maintain certain standards relating to employee benefits, charitable giving and supply chain practices – in 2017 and went on to report record profits in 2020 and 2021. Etsy did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. A spokesperson told Marketwatch: “Sellers have consistently told us they want us to expand our efforts around marketing, customer support and removing listings that don’t meet our policies. Our revised fee structure will enable us to increase our investments in each of these key areas so we can better serve our community and keep Etsy a beloved, trusted and thriving marketplace.” In a blog to Etsy sellers published before the strike, Cassidy wrote: “As individual crafters, makers and small businesspeople, we may be easy for a giant corporation like Etsy to take advantage of. But as an organised front of people, determined to use our diverse skills and boundless creativity to win ourselves a fairer deal, Etsy won’t have such an easy time shoving us around.” After Amazon workers’ historic win last week in establishing its first union in Staten Island, New York City, Cassidy said she believed this could be the start of a new labour movement for the gig economy. “That’s what we wanted to do from the beginning,” she said, adding that more than 500 sellers had committed to work together to grow an Etsy activist campaign.","The move is a response to Etsy, which hosts more than 5.3m businesses, from Monday increasing the fees it charges sellers from 5% to 6.5% – a 30% increase.

79,79,"The latest high-end smartphone from OnePlus is a top-spec device with a good combination of aesthetics and performance, and a price that undercuts rivals. Just don’t sit on it. The 10 Pro costs from £799 ($899), which is still premium priced but £30 cheaper than last year’s model and £250 less than the parent company Oppo’s Find X5 Pro. The phone has one of the best 6.7in OLED screens: bright, crisp and colourful with a 120Hz refresh rate to keep things smooth. The glass sides curve to a shiny metal band and a frosted glass back, which feels particularly nice and stops fingerprints creating a mess. The camera lump in the top-left corner blends into the metal sides and makes for an interesting design element. While big, its curved sides, relatively narrow width and about 200g weight make the 10 Pro comparatively easy to hold compared with similar rivals. It feels solidly made but durability testing has shown that the phone can snap in half if enough pressure is applied. Don’t sit on it and you should be fine. It lacks an official water-resistance rating, too, but should survive rain, splashes or similar accidents. Specifications Screen: 6.7in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (525ppi) Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 RAM: 8 or 12GB of RAM Storage: 128 or 256GB Operating system: OxygenOS 12.1 (Android 12) Camera: 48MP main, 50MP ultra-wide, 8MP 3.3x telephoto; 32MP selfie Connectivity: 5G, eSIM, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5.2 and GNSS Water resistance rating: None Dimensions: 163 x 73.9 x 8.6mm Weight: 200.5g Very fast charging and solid battery life The 10 Pro has the same top chip Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip as most high-end Android phones for 2022, performing admirably with a rapid interface and smooth gaming. Battery life is very good, lasting about 43 hours between charges on average, including three hours spent on 5G. That was with the screen set to the default resolution and actively used for more than six hours. That’s seven hours longer than the nearest rival made by Samsung, meaning the phone will need charging every other night with light usage. It lasts for about five hours of screen on time if the display is increased its maximum QHD+ resolution. Sustainability OnePlus rates the battery for at least 1,000 full charge cycles while maintaining at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone does not contain recycled materials but is generally repairable, with a replacement battery costing about £20 plus labour. OnePlus operates a trade-in scheme and is included in the parent company Oppo’s yearly sustainability reports. OxygenOS 12.1 OnePlus traditionally had one of the best versions of Android on its phones, OxygenOS. While that is still broadly true on this phone, it is now a tweaked version of ColorOS developed the by parent company, Oppo, as seen on the Find X5 Pro, with a slightly different look and operation. It is based on the latest Android 12 and will be updated with bi-monthly security patches for four years from release and supported with three major Android version upgrades. That’s reasonable but a year less support than either Samsung or Google, which provide faster monthly security updates, too. OxygenOS 12.1 doesn’t look quite the same as version 11 from last year but is still a stripped back and fairly slick affair, geared up for western audiences. It has some niggles, including overly aggressive closing of apps running in the background, which is designed to save battery but can delay message notifications or occasionally stop music playing. “Pinning” apps in the multitasking menu stops them being shut down. OnePlus’s software is still one of the best of all the Chinese smartphone brands but isn’t quite as top-notch as it used to be. Camera The 10 Pro has a camera developed with Hasselblad, which is similar to last year’s 9 Pro: a main 48MP, 50MP ultra-wide and an 8MP 3.3x telephoto on the back, plus a capable 32MP selfie camera on the front The main camera generally shoots very good images that are well exposed with good colour balance. It can struggle in very high-contrast scenes but deals with low-light scenarios well. The ultra-wide camera is equally decent, if a little softer on detail and less sensitive in low light. It can shoot extremely wide or fisheye-style photos with fun special modes, too. The 3.3x telephoto camera has a decent level of magnification compared with some rivals and is capable of producing fairly sharp shots in good lighting. But it struggles in lower light levels, quickly becoming grainy. The cameras lack consistency in colour and exposure levels, meaning switching between them produces very different photos in the same scenario, but overall the three cameras are solid even if they can’t beat the best from Samsung, Google or Apple. Price The OnePlus 10 Pro costs £799 ($899) with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage or £899 with 12 and 256GB. For comparison, the Google Pixel 6 Pro costs £849, the Samsung Galaxy S21+ costs £949, the Oppo Find X5 Pro costs £1,049, the Galaxy S21 Ultra costs £1,149 and the iPhone 13 Pro Max costs £1,049. Verdict The OnePlus 10 Pro is a good alternative to a top-spec Google or Samsung Android phone. It offers a potent combination of speed, rapid charging, long battery life and big screen in an attractive, svelte body. The new OxygenOS software is generally good, if not quite as slick as previous versions. You will get four years of software updates from release, which is longer than previous OnePlus phones but a year or more short of Google, Samsung or Apple. The camera is slightly improved all round and generally very usable but it is still OnePlus’s weakest link, unable to trouble the best in the business. These slight knocks can be overlooked at £799, which is good value for a high-end phone, undercutting Google’s excellent value Pixel 6 Pro by £50 and the parent company Oppo’s Find X5 Pro by £250. If you want a good, premium Android phone not made by Samsung or Google, the OnePlus 10 Pro is the one to get. Pros: Slick performance, good software, good battery life, rapid charging, great screen, solid camera with 3.3x optical zoom, attractive design, reasonable price. Cons: camera not quite best-in-class, no water-resistance rating, some software niggles, only four years of updates.","Specifications Screen: 6.7in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (525ppi) Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 RAM: 8 or 12GB of RAM Storage: 128 or 256GB Operating system: OxygenOS 12.1 (Android 12) Camera: 48MP main, 50MP ultra-wide, 8MP 3.3x telephoto; 32MP selfie Connectivity: 5G, eSIM, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5.2 and GNSS Water resistance rating: None Dimensions: 163 x 73.9 x 8.6mm Weight: 200.5g Very fast charging and solid battery life The 10 Pro has the same top chip Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip as most high-end Android phones for 2022, performing admirably with a rapid interface and smooth gaming.

Doesn’t he live in a solid gold mansion on the moon or something? No, nothing like that. So where does he live? You know, around. You mean he has lots of houses all over the place? He doesn’t have any houses. Then where does he sleep? He’s a serial houseguest. “I don’t even own a home right now,” he said in a recent interview. “I’m just literally staying at friends’ places.” This is Musk the rich guy, right?

Maybe not quite. “If I travel to the Bay Area, which is where most of Tesla’s engineering is,” he said, “I basically rotate through friends’ spare bedrooms.” How irritating. Musk was responding to a question about people’s hatred of billionaires, and pointing out his relatively frugal approach to life. Last year, he announced he was getting rid of his possessions. It’s one thing to have admirably modest outgoings; it’s quite another to be a constant imposition. We don’t know that he’s an imposition – maybe his friends are really pleased to see him. I’m sure. “Oh look, it’s Elon at the door with another suitcase full of dirty laundry. How thrilling!” He wasn’t specific about the arrangements, so it’s hard to … “A hotel?

Do you think it might be yours?” This is all speculation on your part – it has no basis in … “Also this pillowcase with the insignia of your private jet on it. Don’t worry, I’ve ironed it.” Still, I’ll bet he remembers to send a nice note afterwards. I’ll bet he doesn’t. No, you’re right. Do say: “The week of the 15th?

81,81,"Self-driving cars could lead to drivers being allowed to watch films on the motorway, under changes to the Highway Code proposed by the Department for Transport The planned updates are intended to smooth the way for adoption of autonomous vehicles on British roads. But they have sparked concern from some, who fear that new regulations may be introduced before the technology is there to support them. What is a self-driving car? The actual definition of a “self-driving” car is hotly contested. At one end of the spectrum, simple driver-assist technologies such as cruise control are decades old, and have been largely incorporated into existing rules without difficulty. At the other end of the spectrum, the dream of a fully autonomous vehicle, that can handle any driving a human can, remains the stuff of science fiction. In between the poles is where disputes lie. Tesla’s “autopilot” technology, for instance, can follow the lanes of a motorway, and handle junctions without intervention, but even drivers who pay the fee to upgrade to what the company calls “full self-driving” must remain at the wheel and alert at all times, in case the car’s software is unable to cope with something unexpected. The industry uses a six-point scale, from 0 to 5, to cover the differences, and considers anything above 3 “automated” to some degree. A level 3 car, like a Tesla, can perform “most” driving tasks, but requires human override occasionally. A level 4 car, like the robot taxis being tested in San Francisco and Phoenix, can perform all driving under specific circumstances – like in a defined city area, for instance – but still preserves the option for human override. Only a level 5 car, which never needs a human to take over and could be made without a steering wheel entirely, is considered “full automation”. Why can I watch a film but not use my phone? The proposal would allow drivers to watch content “not related to driving on built-in display screens, while the self-driving vehicle is in control”. Mobile phones remain specifically banned, however, “given the greater risk they pose in distracting drivers as shown in research”. For a level 5 self-driving car, such a distinction would be moot, since drivers should not be expected to take control ever. For less advanced automation, though, the distinction matters: a built-in screen can be closely linked with the car’s systems, making it easier to alert the driver that they need to pay attention to the road. Can it really be safe to watch a film while a car is driving? If the tech lives up to its promise, it should be. A good implementation of a level 3 or level 4 self-driving car – one that expects drivers to take over occasionally – will also take into account the fact that drivers are naturally poor at monitoring the operation of a machine they do not need to control. This is known as the “paradox of automation”: the more efficient an automated system, the more crucial the human contribution when they’re required. If you have a normal car, the vast majority of your driving is likely to be rote and routine. But if you have a self-driving car that can handle 99% of tasks, then you’re going to be put back in charge only in the most difficult 1% of situations. Many of the setbacks of self-driving cars over the past decade have involved dealing with that problem: how do you ensure that a driver is ready to take over at a moment’s notice, when the promise of the technology involves setting them free to do other things? But the latest generation of self-driving cars prioritise “safe disengagement”, pulling over to the side of the road and coming to a stop when there’s difficulty, rather than handing control back to the driver at 70mph. If those safety features are required, then it really can be safe to watch a film while driving. Whose fault is it if there is a crash? That’s one fight that is still being waged. The British proposals warn that “motorists must be ready to resume control in a timely way if they are prompted to”, the definition of level 4 automation. In most crashes involving self-driving cars, the motorist has technically been at fault – because they haven’t been able to take control in the split second before tragedy occurred. Drivers have been charged in crashes involving Tesla cars, and an experimental Uber self-driving car. But experts have referred to the human drivers in these situations as “moral crumple zones”, parts of the system designed to soak up legal and moral responsibility without having the power to actually improve safety. “While the crumple zone in a car is meant to protect the human driver, the moral crumple zone protects the integrity of the technological system, at the expense of the nearest human operator,” says Madeleine Clare Elish, who coined the term in 2019. But will self-driving cars ever really come to the UK? Level 3 automation is on British streets already, and level 4 is close behind. Companies in Oxford and Milton Keynes have been testing cars on the road for a couple of years, with increasingly positive results. A simpler version of a “driverless car” can see a company pairing a level 4 AI with wireless broadband, enabling remote safety drivers who don’t need to sit in the car behind a steering wheel. But the industry has long struggled with the hardest part of driving a car: other people. Heavily pedestrianised areas, busy unsigned intersections and pulling out into dense traffic all pose significant problems that may prevent level 5 automation from ever becoming a reality.","Self-driving cars could lead to drivers being allowed to watch films on the motorway, under changes to the Highway Code proposed by the Department for Transport The planned updates are intended to smooth the way for adoption of autonomous vehicles on British roads.

82,82,"A safety feature that uses AI technology to scan messages sent to and from children will soon hit British iPhones, Apple has announced. The feature, referred to as “communication safety in Messages”, allows parents to turn on warnings for their children’s iPhones. When enabled, all photos sent or received by the child using the Messages app will be scanned for nudity. If nudity is found in photos received by a child with the setting turned on, the photo will be blurred, and the child will be warned that it may contain sensitive content and nudged towards resources from child safety groups. If nudity is found in photos sent by a child, similar protections kick in, and the child is encouraged not to send the images, and given an option to “Message a Grown-Up”. All the scanning is carried out “on-device”, meaning that the images are analysed by the iPhone itself, and Apple never sees either the photos being analysed or the results of the analysis, it said. “Messages analyses image attachments and determines if a photo contains nudity, while maintaining the end-to-end encryption of the messages,” the company said in a statement. “The feature is designed so that no indication of the detection of nudity ever leaves the device. Apple does not get access to the messages, and no notifications are sent to the parent or anyone else.” Apple has also dropped several controversial options from the update before release. In its initial announcement of its plans, the company suggested that parents would be automatically alerted if young children, under 13, sent or received such images; in the final release, those alerts are nowhere to be found. The company is also introducing a set of features intended to intervene when content related to child exploitation is searched for in Spotlight, Siri or Safari. As originally announced in summer 2021, the communication safety in Messages and the search warnings were part of a trio of features intended to arrive that autumn alongside iOS 15. The third of those features, which would scan photos before they were uploaded to iCloud and report any that matched known child sexual exploitation imagery, proved extremely contentious, and Apple delayed the launch of all three while it negotiated with privacy and child safety groups.","If nudity is found in photos received by a child with the setting turned on, the photo will be blurred, and the child will be warned that it may contain sensitive content and nudged towards resources from child safety groups.

83,83,"Alphabet’s first quarter revenue fell below analysts’ expectations on Tuesday, as the company confronts supply chain problems, inflation concerns, and fallout from the war in Ukraine. In its quarterly earnings report, Google’s parent company said it had made a quarterly profit of $16.436bn, or $24.62 per share, missing expectations of $25.76 per share. Alphabet reported a substantial miss in its YouTube segment, fueled in part by rising competition with the short form video platform TikTok and advertisers responding to high inflation rates. “Google’s underwhelming results underline the view that the search giant is struggling with slowing revenue growth as advertisers cut back on spending due to a slowdown in consumer demand amid the current inflationary environment,” said Jesse Cohen, a senior analyst at Investing.com. First-quarter sales for Alphabet were $68.01bn, 23% higher than last year but below the average estimate of $68.1bn among financial analysts tracked by Refinitiv. The company’s first miss since before the pandemic sent its shares falling 4% in after hours trading. The company attributed its YouTube miss in part to the war in Ukraine. Alphabet has in recent months has suspended all monetization on YouTube channels out of Russia and suspended a number of state media outlets to combat misinformation. In a call with investors on Tuesday, Alphabet’s chief executive officer, Sundar Pichai, said the viewership and customer base for YouTube was evolving and expressed a positive outlook for the future. “In the long run, for me, YouTube is a place where we see users not only come for entertainment – they come to find information,” he said. “They’re coming to learn about things. They’re coming to discover, to research.” Despite the shortfall, Google remains dominant in the online ad market. Google advertising made up 82% of Alphabet’s total revenue in 2021, and it is expected to grab 29% – the leading share – of the $602bn global online ad market in 2022. This is at least the 12th straight year Google has been on top, according to Insider Intelligence. . Cloud sales grew at a slower pace than a quarter ago, and Google’s “other” revenue, which includes app, hardware and subscription sales, was $6.8bn, below estimates of $7.3bn. Product changes to resolve antitrust concerns and rising competition from companies such as Amazon and TikTok are chipping away at ad sales. On Tuesday’s call, Pichai said the company’s answer to TikTok – YouTube shorts – had seen extensive growth in the past year but is still in the early phases of monetization. Though Alphabet shares were down over 17% this year entering Tuesday, they have risen nearly 90% over the past two years. But its disappointing report comes as declines in big tech stocks sent the Nasdaq composite down 4% Tuesday, the worst drop for the tech-heavy index since September 2020. The slump marks a departure from years of runaway success for the tech sector, which had made gangbuster gains for much of the pandemic. With interest rates set to rise as the Federal Reserve steps up its inflation fight, traders are less and less willing to pay the lofty prices they had been paying for Microsoft, Meta, and others. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.4%. Meta will report its earnings on Wednesday.

84,84,"Elon Musk’s self-avowed status as a “free speech absolutist” raises the possibility he will lift the ban on people whose Twitter accounts have been permanently suspended from the platform. The world’s richest man, who has agreed to buy Twitter for $44bn (£34bn), has said he prefers giving users a “timeout” instead of a lifelong ban. Here are some of the most high-profile figures banned from Twitter who might be hoping for a reprieve. Donald Trump The then US president’s account was suspended on 8 January 2021, two days after the storming of the US Capitol. Announcing the ban, Twitter cited Trump’s repeated violations of the company’s rules and the risk of the “further incitement of violence”. Trump, who had more than 88 million followers when he was banned, said on Monday he does not intend to return to Twitter, sticking with his rival platform, Truth Social. Marjorie Taylor Greene The personal account of the Republican Georgia congresswoman was suspended permanently in January this year for violating policies on coronavirus misinformation. She has since expressed hope, on her official government account, that she would again be able to tweet using her private profile in the wake of the Musk deal. Alex Jones The rightwing conspiracy theorist’s account, and that of his Infowars website, were suspended in 2018 due to violations of the platform’s abusive behaviour policy. The two accounts had about 1.3 million followers combined. Milo Yiannopoulos The rightwing writer was banned in 2016 for his role in the online abuse of actor Leslie Jones over her role in a reboot of Ghostbusters. Yiannopoulos told Breitbart.com his suspension was “cowardly” and evidence that Twitter was a “no-go zone for conservatives”. Politics for All The popular UK news aggregation service was banned in the UK in January for violating the rules on platform manipulation and spam. Its success at going viral on Twitter had attracted hundreds of thousands of followers, including MPs and government ministers. David Icke One of the UK’s most prominent conspiracy theorists, Icke was banned in 2020 for violating policies on coronavirus misinformation. The former BBC presenter had made numerous unfounded claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including a discredited theory that it was linked to the rollout of the 5G mobile network.

85,85,"When the job of a young east coast-based analyst – we’ll call him James – went remote with the pandemic, he didn’t envisage any problems. The company, a large US retailer for which he has been a salaried employee for more than half a decade, provided him with a laptop, and his home became his new office. Part of a team dealing with supply chain issues, the job was a busy one, but never had he been reprimanded for not working hard enough. So it was a shock when his team was hauled in one day late last year to an online meeting to be told there was gaps in its work: specifically periods when people – including James himself, he was later informed – weren’t inputting information into the company’s database. As far as team members knew, no one had been watching them on the job. But as it became clear what had happened, James grew furious. Can a company really use computer monitoring tools – known as “bossware” to critics – to tell if you’re productive at work? Or if you’re about to run away to a competitor with proprietary knowledge? Or even, simply, if you’re happy? Many companies in the US and Europe now appear – controversially – to want to try, spurred on by the enormous shifts in working habits during the pandemic, in which countless office jobs moved home and seem set to either stay there or become hybrid. This is colliding with another trend among employers towards the quantification of work – whether physical or digital – in the hope of driving efficiency. “The rise of monitoring software is one of the untold stories of the Covid pandemic,” says Andrew Pakes, deputy general secretary of Prospect, a UK labor union. “This is coming for almost every type of worker,” says Wilneida Negrón, director of research and policy at Coworker, a US based non-profit to help workers organize. Knowledge-centric jobs that went remote during the pandemic are a particular area of growth. A survey last September by review site Digital.com of 1,250 US employers found 60% with remote employees are using work monitoring software of some type, most commonly to track web browsing and application use. And almost nine out of 10 of the companies said they had terminated workers after implementing monitoring software. The number and array of tools now on offer to continuously monitor employees’ digital activity and provide feedback to managers is remarkable. Tracking technology can also log keystrokes, take screenshots, record mouse movements, activate webcams and microphones, or periodically snap pictures without employees knowing. And a growing subset incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) and complex algorithms to make sense of the data being collected. One AI monitoring technology, Veriato, gives workers a daily “risk score” which indicates the likelihood they pose a security threat to their employer. This could be because they may accidentally leak something, or because they intend to steal data or intellectual property. The score is made up from many components, but it includes what an AI sees when it examines the text of a worker’s emails and chats to purportedly determine their sentiment, or changes in it, that can point towards disgruntlement. The company can then subject those people to closer examination. “This is really about protecting consumers and investors as well as employees from making accidental mistakes,” says Elizabeth Harz, CEO. Another company making use of AI, RemoteDesk, has a product meant for remote workers whose job requires a secure environment, because for example they are dealing with credit card details or health information. It monitors workers through their webcams with real-time facial recognition and object detection technology to ensure that no one else looks at their screen and that no recording device, like a phone, comes into view. It can even trigger alerts if a worker eats or drinks on the job, if a company prohibits it. RemoteDesk’s own description of its technology for “work-from-home obedience” caused consternation on Twitter last year. (That language didn’t capture the company’s intention and has been changed, its CEO, Rajinish Kumar, told the Guardian.) But tools that claim to assess a worker’s productivity seem poised to become the most ubiquitous. In late 2020, Microsoft rolled out a new product it called Productivity Score which rated employee activity across its suite of apps, including how often they attended video meetings and sent emails. A widespread backlash ensued, and Microsoft apologised and revamped the product so workers couldn’t be identified. But some smaller companies are happily pushing the envelope. Prodoscore, founded in 2016, is one. Its software is being used to monitor about 5000 workers at various companies. Each employee gets a daily “productivity score” out of 100 which is sent to a team’s manager and the worker, who will also see their ranking among their peers. The score is calculated by a proprietary algorithm that weighs and aggregates the volume of a worker’s input across all the company’s business applications – email, phones, messaging apps, databases. Only about half of Prodoscore’s customers tell their employees they’re being monitored using the software (the same is true for Veriato). The tool is “employee friendly”, maintains CEO Sam Naficy, as it gives employees a clear way of demonstrating they are actually working at home. “[Just] keep your Prodoscore north of 70,” says Naficy. And because it is only scoring a worker based on their activity, it doesn’t come with the same gender, racial or other biases that human managers might, the company argues. Prodoscore doesn’t suggest that businesses make consequential decisions for workers – for example about bonuses, promotions or firing – based on its scores. Though “at the end of the day, it’s their discretion”, says Naficy. Rather it is intended as a “complementary measurement” to a worker’s actual outputs, which can help businesses see how people are spending their time or rein in overworking. Naficy lists legal and tech firms as its customers, but those approached by the Guardian declined to speak about what they do with the product. One, the major US newspaper publisher Gannett, responded that it is only used by a small sales division of about 20 people. A video surveillance company named DTiQ is quoted on Prodoscore’s website as saying that declining scores accurately predicted which employees would leave. Prodoscore shortly plans to launch a separate “happiness/wellbeing index” which will mine a team’s chats and other communications in an attempt to discover how workers are feeling. It would, for example, be able to forewarn of an unhappy employee who may need a break, Naficy claims. But what do workers themselves think about being surveilled like this? James and the rest of his team at the US retailer learned that, unbeknownst to them, the company had been monitoring their keystrokes into the database. In the moment when he was being rebuked, James realized some of the gaps would actually be breaks – employees needed to eat. Later, he reflected hard on what had happened. While having his keystrokes tracked surreptitiously was certainly disquieting, it wasn’t what really smarted. Rather what was “infuriating”, “soul crushing” and a “kick in the teeth” was that the higher-ups had failed to grasp that inputting data was only a small part of his job, and was therefore a bad measure of his performance. Communicating with vendors and couriers actually consumed most of his time. “It was the lack of human oversight,” he says. “It was ‘your numbers are not matching what we want, despite the fact that you have proven your performance is good’… They looked at the individual analysts almost as if we were robots.” To critics, this is indeed a dismaying landscape. “A lot of these technologies are largely untested,” says Lisa Kresge, a research and policy associate at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Centre and co-author of the recent report Data and Algorithms at Work. Productivity scores give the impression that they are objective and impartial and can be trusted because they are technologically derived – but are they? Many use activity as a proxy for productivity, but more emails or phone calls don’t necessarily translate to being more productive or performing better. And how the proprietary systems arrive at their scores is often as unclear to managers as it is to workers, says Kresge. Moreover systems that automatically classify a worker’s time into “idle” and “productive” are making value judgments about what is and isn’t productive, notes Merve Hickok, research director at the Center for AI and Digital Policy and founder of AIethicist.org. A worker who takes time to train or coach a colleague might be classified as unproductive because there is less traffic originating from their computer, she says. And productivity scores that force workers to compete can lead to them trying to game the system rather than actually do productive work. AI models, often trained on databases of previous subjects’ behaviour, can also be inaccurate and bake in bias. Problems with gender and racial bias have been well documented in facial recognition technology. And there are privacy issues. Remote monitoring products that involve a webcam can be particularly problematic: there could be a clue a worker is pregnant (a crib in the background), of a certain sexual orientation or living with an extended family. “It gives employers a different level of information than they would have otherwise,” says Hickok. There is also a psychological toll. Being monitored lowers your sense of perceived autonomy, explains Nathanael Fast, an associate professor of management at the University of Southern California who co-directs its Psychology of Technology Institute. And that can increase stress and anxiety. Research on workers in the call centre industry – which has been a pioneer of electronic monitoring – highlights the direct relationship between extensive monitoring and stress. Computer programmer and remote work advocate David Heinemeier Hansson has been waging a one-company campaign against the vendors of the technology. Early in the pandemic he announced that the company he co-founded, Basecamp, which provides project management software for remote working, would ban vendors of the technology from integrating with it. The companies tried to push back, says Hansson – “very few of them see themselves as purveyors of surveillance technology” – but Basecamp couldn’t be complicit in supporting technology that resulted in workers being subjected to such “inhuman treatment”, he says. Hansson isn’t naive enough to think his stance is going to change things. Even if other companies followed Basecamp’s lead, it wouldn’t be enough to quench the market. What is really needed, argue Hansson and other critics, is better laws regulating how employers can use algorithms and protect workers’ mental health. In the US, except in a few states that have introduced legislation, employers aren’t even required to specifically disclose monitoring to workers. (The situation is better in the UK and Europe, where general rights around data protection and privacy exist, but the system suffers from lack of enforcement.) Hansson also urges managers to reflect on their desire to monitor workers. Tracking may catch that “one goofer out of 100” he says. “But what about the other 99 whose environment you have rendered completely insufferable?” As for James, he is looking for another job where “toxic” monitoring habits aren’t a feature of work life.","Many companies in the US and Europe now appear – controversially – to want to try, spurred on by the enormous shifts in working habits during the pandemic, in which countless office jobs moved home and seem set to either stay there or become hybrid.

86,86,"Amazon announced its first loss since 2015 on Thursday as sales slowed, costs rose and its investment in electric vehicle company Rivian wiped out profits. The news sent Amazon’s shares tumbling by 10% in after hours trading. The tech giant’s revenues grew at a sluggish 7% in the first quarter to $116.4bn, Amazon’s slowest growth rate in nearly two decades. For the same quarter last year, Amazon’s sales increased 44% to $108.5bn. It lost $3.8bn for the quarter compared with a profit of $8.1bn during the same period a year ago. The company warned there may be more losses ahead. For the current quarter, Amazon expects operating income between a loss of $1bn and a gain of $3bn, compared with $7.7bn in second quarter of 2021. Amazon’s stake in electric vehicle company Rivian was largely to blame for the loss. Amazon owns close to 20% of the company and lost $7.6bn after shares in the electric vehicle collapsed, falling by more than 50%. “The pandemic and subsequent war in Ukraine have brought unusual growth and challenges,” said Andy Jassy, the Amazon chief executive officer. Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s chief financial officer, said incremental costs from inflation, warehouse capacity exceeding demands and other issues had cost the company about $6bn over the quarter. Amazon was one of the biggest winners of the pandemic, recording huge jumps in sales as consumers moved to shopping online and companies turned to Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing unit, to run their businesses. AWS sales increased 37% over the quarter. As Covid-19 vaccination rates increase and hospitalizations fall, shoppers are switching back to bricks and mortar. In-store shopping rose 11.2% in March while online fell 3.3%, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, a monthly transactions report. Amazon is not the only online retailer feeling the change. The share of retail purchases made online has dropped from 15.7% in the second quarter of 2020 to 12.9% during the last three months of 2021, according to Census Bureau data. But as Mastercard’s survey shows, online retailers gained hugely over the pandemic. E-commerce grew over 83% from March 2019 to March 2022 compared to a 9.4% growth rate for in-store shopping. The company faces additional pressure from employees across the country who are pushing to unionize and negotiate for higher wages, better working conditions and benefits. Earlier this month Amazon workers in Staten Island, New York, became the first to vote for a union in the US. Votes to establish a union at a second Amazon facility in New York will be counted on Monday and organizers say they have been inundated with calls from other Amazon outposts to help them set up unions. “Today, as we’re no longer chasing physical or staffing capacity, our teams are squarely focused on improving productivity and cost efficiencies throughout our fulfillment network. We know how to do this and have done it before. This may take some time, particularly as we work through ongoing inflationary and supply chain pressures, but we see encouraging progress,” said Jassy.","The tech giant’s revenues grew at a sluggish 7% in the first quarter to $116.4bn, Amazon’s slowest growth rate in nearly two decades.

87,87,"In July 2021, specialist police officers in Manchester swooped on an international cryptocurrency scam, seizing USB sticks and an online safe containing £16m worth of digital coins, mostly ethereum. A month earlier, Leicestershire police had confiscated 10 types of cryptocurrency after raiding the home of a drug dealer who used digital assets to buy and sell class A drugs. Both operations pale in comparison to the Metropolitan police’s record crypto haul of the same year, worth £180m. But all three, and many more besides, are part of a spreading crypto-crimewave laid bare today by a series of freedom of information requests. The Observer requested data from the 45 regional police services in the UK asking for a breakdown of cryptocurrency seizures since 2017. The information sent back by the 27 forces that responded reveals a big shift: there has been a significant increase in the number of raids, and a proliferation in the types of digital coin criminals are using to invest the proceeds of their activities. More than half of the forces that responded seized crypto-assets during 2021, confiscating or restricting access to 22 different types of digital currency. This was a significant increase on 2020, when four types of crypto were seized, by eight police services. The figure was even lower in 2019, when only two types of digital currency were seized. While the best-known digital currencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, featured more than any others, the figures reveal the increasing popularity among convicted and suspected criminals of much less well known rivals. “Bitcoin is still key: it’s digital gold,” says Gurvais Grigg, who spent 23 years with the FBI and now works as chief technology officer for the data consultancy Chainalysis, which helps private companies and law enforcement bodies trace the movement of cryptocurrencies. “You’ve seen this emergence of ethereum, ‘stablecoins’ [cryptocurrencies pinned to a real-world asset] and a much more diverse market. As a result you’re going to find more of those currencies in the pockets of criminals, because they’re taking them from people.” In the Leicestershire case, police emerged with assets including Enjin Coin, Polkadot, Neo and even Chiliz, the crypto-tokens sold to football fans to enable them to access perks and vote on decisions at their clubs. In Wales, the South Wales Regional Organised Crime Unit seized eight crypto-assets, including one called Cake, while its counterpart in the south-west confiscated seven, including the Luxury Coin. “It’s an emerging field that’s come at us like a tidal wave, and policing has to adapt with the times,” says Phil Ariss, who coordinates the national police response to crypto-crime. “It’s a big learning curve, but we’re doing well.” He says 300 police officers have been trained in crypto, with hundreds more due to receive instruction. But the scope of the challenge is even greater than outlined by the Observer’s freedom of information requests. While some services haven’t made seizures themselves, “most are involved in investigations”, he says, with officers working on cases featuring between 35 and 40 types of coin. “It’s not just investments and theft, in some extreme cases it’s terrorism financing. It can be purchasing of child abuse images, money laundering. We’re seeing a huge span of cases across law enforcement,” he says. Most police services don’t disclose the amount of cryptocurrency involved, for fear that other bad actors, armed with such granular detail, could spot when seizures had taken place. Leicestershire police said it might give them “forewarning” of an investigation that could affect them, allowing them to take steps to hide ill-gotten gains. However, Dyfed-Powys police, which patrols a mostly rural area in which Llanelli is the largest town, told the Observer it had taken possession of 82 bitcoins in 2021, with a value of £2.5m at the most recent price. When the police do confiscate such digital assets, they are not well equipped to store them themselves. Instead, Avon and Somerset police explains, they contract that job out, storing the bounty “in a secure wallet with a third party provider”. They decline to name the companies involved, citing security reasons; there is a danger of workers at crypto-exchanges being targeted. In 2017, Pavel Lerner, a UK-based exchange employee, was abducted by gun-toting men wearing balaclavas in Ukraine. He was only released after a ransom was paid. Every police service that responded to the FoI requests referred to this case as a reason why they would not disclose holders of seized cryptocurrencies. “The above incident is not the only one of its kind,” Avon and Somerset police says. “As such, providing information to the wider public about the volume of assets stored and where they are stored increases the risk of cyber-attacks, insider threat and other hostile actions by those who may wish to infiltrate either the supplier or law enforcement.” In theory, the growing attraction of cryptocurrency to criminals is obvious. Large amounts of money can be sent across borders quickly, into jurisdictions that do not necessarily cooperate with UK law enforcement. According to Grigg, though, criminals should not get overconfident. Transactions that take place on the blockchain are, by their nature, logged. That means, with the right time and resources, they can be traced, and perpetrators apprehended, long after crimes have been committed. On the dark web, mixing services are available that allow criminals to launder their crypto, blending it with other types of assets to scatter the paper trail and throw investigators off their tail. But Grigg says that determined, well resourced investigators can still get there in the end. “Tracing tools have got better and data availability is better,” he says. The growing number of seizures in the UK is not just a reflection of more crime, he says, but of the growing ability of police officers to stop it. In addition, he points out, the legitimate crypto market has grown faster than the volume of crime-related transactions has. Illicit crypto addresses received $14bn during 2021, according to Chainalysis – a record sum, but an all-time low in terms of share of total volume, at just 0.15%. Yet as long as the crypto world is expanding rapidly, the challenge for law enforcement will grow alongside it. A separate freedom of information disclosure, shared with the Observer, reveals a significant increase in reports of crypto-related fraud last year. There were 9,607 such reports made to the national reporting hotline Action Fraud last year, according to the City of London police, up from 5,581 the year before and 3,558 in 2019. Victims, who were disproportionately likely to be under 35 and male, flagged financial losses of more than £200m. David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain, says more crypto equals more crime. “More people are using the stuff,” he says. “There are minor coins, known as ‘shitcoins’, for everything these days. “There will be a lot more scams because more people are promoting it. Times are tough, people are worried, so they’re prey to false hope and get-rich-quick schemes.” But Ariss points out that the greater the public’s interest in crypto, the greater also the awareness and understanding among the police officers trying to prevent ordinary people from becoming victims. “The [expansion] of crypto in the consciousness of the wider public also affects police officers. You only have to go on the tube and you see ads; crypto companies are sponsoring sports teams. On Crypto.com you’ve got Matt Damon endorsing it. “There’s an awareness that permeates, and in some ways the challenge [of training officers] is easier now than it ever has been.” Ariss says British police are keeping pace, so far. “We’re in a good place compared to some partners in international law enforcement. “The wheels of justice turn slowly so some of those good news stories haven’t come out yet, but time will show we’re doing a very good job.”","The information sent back by the 27 forces that responded reveals a big shift: there has been a significant increase in the number of raids, and a proliferation in the types of digital coin criminals are using to invest the proceeds of their activities.

88,88,"Garmin’s latest rugged solar-powered smartwatch, the Instinct 2, promises unlimited battery life. You just have to stay in the sun. Looking more like a rugged digital watch such as Casio’s legendary G-Shock than an Apple or Samsung smartwatch, the Garmin feels made to take a beating with its monochrome screen, physical buttons and sturdy body. It costs from £299.99 ($349.99/A$549) and comes in various versions such as one for surfing and even one for professional truck drivers. But it is the solar charging models, costing £389.99, that promise never to need to be plugged in for power. Underneath the rugged exterior is Garmin’s smartwatch tech, featuring market-leading sport, health and location-tracking. It has smartphone connectivity for notifications, alerts and syncing your data via the Connect app on an Android or iPhone. It is very similar to many other Garmin sport watches, but what sets the Instinct 2 apart is its promise of incredible battery life even without the power of the sun. The standard 45mm model without solar will last up to 28 days used as a general smartwatch, which is 10 days longer than the already impressive Fenix 7 and about 14 times longer than an Apple Watch. The solar version, which charges using a transparent “power glass” covering the screen and panels around the edge of the display, promises to keep the battery topped up for essentially unlimited battery life as long as you spend at least three hours in direct sunlight (50,000 lux of light). How realistic that is depends on your day-to-day activities. On a sunny winter’s day in London the watch received 40,000 lux of direct sunlight through a window, so if you spend your days outside rather than locked in an office it seems more than feasible. For mainly indoor usage during winter without much in the way of solar charging, the watch lasted about 15 days between charges, including five hours of workout-tracking. I wore it 24 hours a day with message alerts, heart rate, stress, calories, general activity and health monitoring, plus sleep and blood oxygen (SpO2) tracking overnight. Turning off the Sp02 sensor added days to the life as did limiting workouts. The solar charging would add at least 24 hours battery for each sunny spring day spent outside, too. Specifications Screen: monochrome transflective MIP LCD Case size: 40 or 45mm Case thickness: 13.3 to 14.5mm Band size: standard 20 or 22mm quick fit Weight: 42 to 53g Water resistance: 100 metres (10ATM) Sensors: GNSS (GPS, Glonass, Galileo), compass, thermometer, heart rate, pulse Ox Connectivity: Bluetooth, ANT+ Of course its battery prowess comes at the cost of features on fancier-looking Garmin watches such as the Fenix 7 or rivals like the Apple Watch. The Instinct 2 lacks a touchscreen, though the button-based interface is fast and logical. It lacks the new high-accuracy multi-band GPS tracking technology, but still has an altimeter, barometer and compass. The biggest missing features are offline music playback, such as Spotify without having to use your phone, and offline maps. It can plot breadcrumb trails of where you have been on an activity to help you get back to the start, guide you in the direction of points of interest and even measure the area of a space by walking its perimeter, but it has no maps available. The watch tracks a vast number of activities including various forms of running, walking, cycling, swimming, strength, cardio, Hiit and more exotic ones such as paddle boarding, hunting, fishing, backcountry skiing and bouldering. Some activities are restricted to special versions of the watch, such as the jumpmaster mode for skydiving being only available on the “tactical edition”, surfing and tide information on the “surf edition” and the truck-driver tools on the “dēzl edition” to plan breaks and workouts. Only the solar models have Garmin Pay for contactless payments too, which supports few UK banks but is useful in emergencies when out on excursions without a credit card or phone. On the health front, it has Garmin’s excellent body battery, which makes it easy to understand the impact of sleep, activity and rest on your day, plus stress tracking, abnormal heart rate alerts, daily workout suggestions, Vo2 Max fitness measurement and recovery estimation after exercise and many other features. All the activity and health information the watch collects is sent via Bluetooth to the excellent Garmin Connect app on your phone, within which you can pore over mountains of data, graphs and insights. Plus you can connect it straight to social networks such as Strava. Price The Garmin Instinct 2 comes in two sizes and various models, starting at £299.99 ($349.99/A$549) for the standard version or £389.99 ($449.99/A$699) with solar charging. For comparison, the Garmin Forerunner 55 costs £149.99, Venu 2 costs from £349.99, Fenix 7 costs from £599.99, Epix costs from £799.99, the Coros Apex costs £299.99 and the Polar Grit X costs £369. Verdict The Instinct 2 Solar is the closest model so far to what is the holy grail of smartwatch makers – a watch which you never have to plug into the charger. It looks and feels more like a traditional digital watch, but is backed by Garmin’s comprehensive activity and general health tracking, and simple smartphone notifications. It lacks a few bells and whistles you get with less rugged smartwatch rivals, such as voice assistants, maps, offline music or ECG (heart rhythm) measurement, but its features will probably be more than enough for those not looking for an Apple Watch or similar. If you spend long enough each day in the sun or bright environments you may never need to charge it. For those of us more often confined to the indoors, it’ll still last close to a month or longer with some less necessary features disabled. The Instinct 2 is expensive and certainly not for everyone, but if you’re an outdoors person or looking for a smarter health-tracking version of a digital watch, the Garmin is great. Pros: potentially unlimited battery life with solar charging, tracks lots of activities and health metrics, cross-platform phone notifications, 100m water resistance, durable design, choice of colours and versions. Cons: expensive, no offline music or maps, limited smartwatch features compared with Apple or Samsung, no voice control, screen basic compared to OLED or other Garmins.

89,89,"AI progress comes in fits and starts. You hear nothing for months and then, suddenly, the limits of what seems possible are burst asunder. April was one of those months, with two major new releases in the field stunning onlookers. The first was Google’s PaLM, a new language model (the same basic type of AI as the famous GPT series) that shows a pretty stunning ability to comprehend and parse complex statements – and explain what it’s doing in the process. Take this simple comprehension question from the company’s announcement: Prompt: Which of the following sentences makes more sense? 1. I studied hard because I got an A on the test. 2. I got an A on the test because I studied hard. Model Response: I got an A on the test because I studied hard. Or this: Prompt: Q: A president rides a horse. What would have happened if the president had ridden a motorcycle? 1. She or he would have enjoyed riding the horse. 2. They would have jumped a garden fence. 3. She or he would have been faster. 4. The horse would have died. Model Response: She or he would have been faster. These are the sorts of questions that computers have historically struggled with, that require a fairly broad understanding of basic facts about the world before you can begin tackling the statement in front of you. (For another example, try parsing the famous sentence “time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana”). So poor Google that, less than a week later, its undeniable achievements with PaLM were overshadowed by a far more photogenic release from OpenAI, the formerly Musk-backed research lab that spawned GPT and its successors. The lab showed off Dall-E 2 (as in, a hybrid of Wall-E and Dalí), an image generation AI with the ability to take text descriptions in natural language and spit out alarmingly detailed images. A picture is worth a thousand words, so here’s a short book about Dall-E 2, with the pictures accompanied by the captions that generated them. From the official announcement, “An astronaut playing basketball with cats in space in a watercolor style”: And “A bowl of soup as a planet in the universe as a 1960s poster”: From the academic paper going into detail about how Dall-E 2 works, “a shiba inu wearing a beret and black turtleneck”: And “a teddy bear on a skateboard in times square”: Not all the prompts have to be in conversational English, and throwing in a bunch of keywords can help tune what the system does. In this case, “artstation” is the name of an illustration social network, and Dall-E is effectively being told “make these images as you’d expect to see them on artstation”. And so: “panda mad scientist mixing sparkling chemicals, artstation” “a dolphin in an astronaut suit on saturn, artstation” The system can do more than simple generation, though. It can produce variations on a theme, effectively by looking at an image, describing it itself, and then creating more images based on that description. Here’s what it gets from Dalí’s famous The Persistence of Memory, for instance: And it can create images that are a blend of two, in a similar way. Here’s Starry Night merging with two dogs: It can also use one image as an anchor and then modify it with a text description. Here we see a “photo of a cat” becoming “an anime drawing of a super saiyan cat, artstation”: These images are all, of course, cherrypicked. They are the best, most compelling examples of what the AI can produce. OpenAI has not, despite its name, opened up access to Dall-E 2 to all, but it has allowed a few people to play with the model, and is taking applications for a waiting list in the meantime. Dave Orr, a Google AI staffer, is one lucky winner, and published a critical assessment: “One thing to be aware of when you see amazing pictures that DE2 generates, is that there is some cherrypicking going on. It often takes a few prompts to find something awesome, so you might have looked at dozens of images or more.” Orr’s post also highlights the weaknesses of the system. Despite being a sibling to GPT, for instance, Dall-E 2 can’t really do writing; it focuses on looking right, rather than reading right, leading to images like this, caption “a street protest in belfast”: There’s one last load of images to look at, and it’s a much less rosy one. OpenAI published a detailed document on the “Risks and Limitations” of the tool, and when laid out in one large document, it’s positively alarming. Every major concern from the past decade of AI research is represented somewhere. Take bias and stereotypes: ask Dall-E for a nurse, and it will produce women. Ask it for a lawyer, it will produce men. A “restaurant” will be western; a “wedding” will be heterosexual: The system will also merrily produce explicit content, depicting nudity or violence, even though the team endeavoured to filter that out of its training material. “Some prompts requesting this kind of content are caught with prompt filtering in the DALL·E 2 Preview,” they say, but new problems are thrown up: the use of the 🍆 emoji, for instance, seems to have confused Dall-E 2, so that “‘A person eating eggplant for dinner’; contained phallic imagery in the response.” OpenAI also addresses a more existential problem: the fact that the system will happily generate “trademarked logos and copyrighted characters”. It’s not great on the face of it if your cool new AI keeps spitting out Mickey Mouse images and Disney has to send a stern word. But it also raises awkward questions about the training data for the system, and whether training an AI using images and text scraped off the public internet is, or should be, legal. Not everyone was impressed by OpenAI’s efforts to warn about the harms. “It’s not good enough to simply write reports about the risks of this technology. This is the AI lab equivalent of thoughts and prayers – without action it doesn’t mean anything,” says Mike Cook, a researcher in AI creativity. “It’s useful to read these documents and there are interesting observations in them … But it’s also clear that certain options – such as halting work on these systems – are not on the table. The argument given is that building these systems helps us understand risks and develop solutions, but what did we learn between GPT-2 and GPT-3? It’s just a bigger model with bigger problems. “You don’t need to build a bigger nuclear bomb to know we need disarmament and missile defence. You build a bigger nuclear bomb if you want to be the person who owns the biggest nuclear bomb. OpenAI wants to be a leader, to make products, to build licensable technology. They cannot stop this work for that reason, they’re incapable of it. So the ethics stuff is a dance, much like greenwashing and pinkwashing is with other corporations. They must be seen to make motions towards safety, while maintaining full speed ahead on their work. And just like greenwashing and pinkwashing, we must demand more and lobby for more oversight.” Almost a year on from the first time we looked at a cutting edge AI tool in this newsletter, the field hasn’t shown any signs of getting less contentious. And we haven’t even touched on the chance that AI could “go FOOM” and change the world. File that away for a future letter.

90,90,"Amazon has reportedly fired over half a dozen senior managers who were involved in a New York warehouse union. The firings, which took place outside the company’s employee review cycle, was regarded as the company’s response to the Amazon Labor Union which formed in Staten Island last month in a “historic victory” against the country’s second largest employer, the New York Times reported, citing former and current employees who spoke on the condition anonymity. Most of the managers who were fired were responsible for carrying out Amazon’s response to the unionization efforts, the New York Times reported. According to their LinkedIn profiles that were reviewed by the Times, some of the managers were with the company for more than six years. Amazon said the changes were made after evaluating the warehouse’s “operations and leadership” for several weeks. “Part of our culture at Amazon is to continually improve, and we believe it’s important to take time to review whether or not we’re doing the best we could be for our team,” the spokesperson said. The managers were being fired due to an “organizational change”, two employees told the Times. One said that some of the managers had recently received positive performance reviews. In April, Amazon workers at the Staten Island warehouse voted in majority to form a union. The victory marked the first successful American organizing effort in the company’s history. Organizers have faced an uphill battle against Amazon, which now employs more than one million people in the US and is making every effort to keep unions out. Christian Smalls, who heads the Amazon Labor Union, said on Twitter he had met with Joe Biden shortly after he harshly criticized Amazon during his testimony at a Senate hearing on Thursday. Pro-union workers were seeking longer breaks, paid time off for injured employees and an hourly wage of $30, up from a minimum of just over $18 an hour offered by the company. The estimated average wage for the borough is $41 an hour, according to a similar US Census Bureau analysis of Staten Island’s $85,381 median household income. Amazon has said they invest in wages and benefits, such as health care, 401(k) plans and a prepaid college tuition program to help grow workers’ careers. “As a company, we don’t think unions are the best answer for our employees,” a spokesperson said following the union win. “Our focus remains on working directly with our team to continue making Amazon a great place to work.” Earlier this week, Amazon warehouse workers at a second Staten Island warehouse overwhelmingly rejected a union bid, dealing a blow to organizers who pulled off the Staten Island union last month. Organizers said they had lost some support at the warehouse after filing for an election in February because they directed more energy to the nearby facility that voted to unionize last month. There were also fewer organizers who worked in this facility – roughly 10, compared with the nearly 30 employed at the Staten Island warehouse. The same obstacles that plagued the effort the first time, including Amazon‘s aggressive anti-union tactics, were at play again. In the lead-up to the election, Amazon continued to hold mandatory meetings to persuade its workers to reject the union effort, posted anti-union flyers and launched a website urging workers to “vote NO”. “Right now, the ALU is trying to come between our relationship with you,” a post on the website reads. “They think they can do a better job advocating for you than you are doing for yourself.”","The firings, which took place outside the company’s employee review cycle, was regarded as the company’s response to the Amazon Labor Union which formed in Staten Island last month in a “historic victory” against the country’s second largest employer, the New York Times reported, citing former and current employees who spoke on the condition anonymity.

91,91,"Thieves are targeting digital currency investors on the street in a wave of “crypto muggings”, police have warned, with victims reporting that thousands of pounds have been stolen after their mobile phones were seized. Anonymised crime reports provided to the Guardian by City of London police, as part of a freedom of information request, reveal criminals are combining physical muscle with digital knowhow to part people from their cryptocurrency. One victim reported they had been trying to order an Uber near London’s Liverpool Street station when muggers forced them to hand over their phone. While the gang eventually gave the phone back, the victim later realised that £5,000-worth of ethereum digital currency was missing from their account with the crypto investing platform Coinbase. In another case, a man was approached by a group of people offering to sell him cocaine and agreed to go down an alley with them to do the deal. The men offered to type a number into his phone but instead accessed his cryptocurrency account, holding him against a wall and forcing him to unlock a smartphone app with facial verification. They transferred £6,000-worth of ripple, another digital currency, out of his account. A third victim said he had been vomiting under a bridge when a mugger forced him to unlock his phone using a fingerprint, then changed his security settings and stole £28,700, including cryptocurrency. In another case, a victim told police that his cards and phone were pickpocketed after an evening at the pub, with £10,000 later stolen from their account with the investing platform Crypto.com. The victim was using his phone in the pub and believed thieves saw him type in his account pin, the report said. “It’s a sort of crypto mugging,” said David Gerard, the author of Attack on the 50 Foot Blockchain, a book on digital currencies. Cryptocurrency transfers are irreversible, unlike a bank transfer, making this type of crime more attractive to thieves. “If I get robbed and they force me to make a bank transfer, the bank can trace where the money has gone and there are all sorts of comebacks. You can reverse the transaction. “With crypto, if I transfer it to my crypto wallet I’ve got your coins and you can’t get them back.” He said the risks were exacerbated by the way some people handle their investments on smartphones, without exercising the same degree of caution they would with cash. “People keep stupid amounts of money on account in crypto. They don’t think it’s money somehow.” Gurvais Grigg, a 23-year veteran of the FBI, now works as public sector chief technology officer for Chainalysis, which helps government agencies and financial institutions track movements of digital currency. He said the nature of cryptocurrency, where transactions are logged on the blockchain, meant police should, in theory, be able to track stolen crypto. “To [transfer stolen assets], they have to provide a wallet address and, most likely, they’ll use that wallet address again in the future. You also need to bring it to an exchange if you want to turn it into fiat currency.” He said this created a digital paper trail that investigators can, and regularly do, use to track down multimillion-dollar crypto hacks. However, he said they were less likely to have the resources to pursue smaller, one-off crimes. “An individual theft of a small amount may not get the attention of the police or a large law enforcement agency. “If they could put together a larger conspiracy of activity, where people are doing it more than once or twice, police services would likely pay attention.” The crypto muggings took place in the second half of 2021, in the relatively small part of London’s financial district patrolled by City of London police. The incidents are not the first in which people have been forced to hand over cryptocurrency with the threat of violence. A student in Kent claimed last year that eight people stormed his university accommodation and forced him to transfer £68,000 of bitcoin at knifepoint. Later that year, the American technology entrepreneur Zaryn Dentzel told police he had been attacked at home in Madrid by masked thieves. He said they tortured him with a knife and stun gun before disappearing with millions of euros in bitcoin. However, the nature of the crimes reported in London last year – apparently opportunistic street incidents akin to a mugging for cash or valuables – is presenting new challenges for the police. Phil Ariss, who leads the cryptocurrency team on the National Police Chiefs’ Council cybercrime programme, said more training was being given to police officers on a variety of crypto-related crimes. He said police were also looking at ways to inform the public about the need to be cautious when accessing a crypto account. “You wouldn’t walk down the street holding £50 notes and counting them. That should apply to people with crypto assets,” he said.","Anonymised crime reports provided to the Guardian by City of London police, as part of a freedom of information request, reveal criminals are combining physical muscle with digital knowhow to part people from their cryptocurrency.

The most recent iteration of the music player, the iPod Touch, has not been updated since 2019, and many of its features are now available on other products. Apple said it would continue to sell the Touch, the only generation of the iPod still on sale, “while supplies last”. The iPod was released in 2001, and was the first MP3 player capable of storing 1,000 songs. Aside from the Touch, versions included the iPod mini, iPod Nano, and iPod Shuffle. By 2011, Apple held a 70% global market share in MP3 players, and to date more than 400m iPods have been sold. The company stopped selling the Nano and Shuffle, its last standalone music players, in 2017, and industry experts had long predicted the Touch would follow given the prevalence of the iPhone and other smartphones that can be used to listen to music. Later versions of the Touch increasingly resembled smartphones, allowing users to take photos, send emails and make video calls. In a statement announcing the discontinuation, Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, said the “spirit of iPod lives on”. “Music has always been part of our core at Apple, and bringing it to hundreds of millions of users in the way iPod did impacted more than just the music industry – it also redefined how music is discovered, listened to and shared,” he said.","The most recent iteration of the music player, the iPod Touch, has not been updated since 2019, and many of its features are now available on other products.

93,93,"Twitter announced the departure of two top leaders in a major shakeup that comes as billionaire Elon Musk is working to close a $44bn deal to acquire the company. In an email to employees on Thursday, chief executive Parag Agrawal said Twitter’s leaders for consumer product and revenue will leave the company. Agrawal said the company was temporarily pausing hiring, and would review all existing job offers to determine whether any “should be pulled back”. Agrawal said Twitter was not able to hit user growth and revenue milestones to maintain confidence that it could reach aggressive growth targets it had set in 2020. “We need to continue to be intentional about our teams, hiring and costs,” Agrawal wrote. Catherine Hill, a spokeswoman from Twitter confirmed by email the two employees would be leaving the company. “We are pulling back on non-labor costs to ensure we are being responsible and efficient,” she added. “Effective this week, we are pausing most hiring and backfills, except for business critical roles.” Among the departures are the social media platform’s head of consumer product, Kayvon Beykpour, and head of revenue, Bruce Falck. Both executives confirmed their exits on Thursday morning on Twitter. Beykpour said he was informed he would be terminated while on paternity leave. “The truth is that this isn’t how and when I imagined leaving Twitter, and this wasn’t my decision,” he said in a tweet. “Parag asked me to leave after letting me know that he wants to take the team in a different direction.” Falck was also fired, according to a tweet that has since been deleted. His Twitter bio now says “unemployed”. Agrawal had installed both the executives in those roles in a reorganization of the company when he took over as chief executive officer in December, after founder Jack Dorsey stepped down from the role. The departures come as the tech industry grapples with a slowdown following explosive growth amid the pandemic, which sent many workplaces online. Facebook parent company Meta also is “slowing growth” in hiring, it confirmed on Wednesday, after difficult earnings reports in recent quarters. Musk’s decision to buy Twitter has raised concerns with investors and employees over the future of the company. Twitter shares fell to $46 on Thursday, well below the purchase price Musk agreed to of $54.20. On his personal account, where he has 92.5 million followers, Musk has mused about creating a subscription model for the social media platform, verifying all users, and returning the homepage to a chronological timeline from its current algorithmic feed. Twitter’s reorganization could also create some financial cushion should Musk choose to back out of the deal, which will take months to finalize. The executive could still walk away from the purchase, though he would be required to pay a $1bn fee to do so. Musk is worth more than $220bn.","Twitter announced the departure of two top leaders in a major shakeup that comes as billionaire Elon Musk is working to close a $44bn deal to acquire the company. “Parag asked me to leave after letting me know that he wants to take the team in a different direction.” Falck was also fired, according to a tweet that has since been deleted.

94,94,"How do you become the richest man in the world? In Elon Musk’s case, part of it involves making workers in China put in hours that would be unacceptable according to labor norms elsewhere. On Tuesday, the Tesla boss praised Chinese factory workers for pulling extreme hours while taking a shot at American workers. “There is just a lot of super talented hardworking people in China who strongly believe in manufacturing,” the billionaire said. “They won’t just be burning the midnight oil, they will be burning the 3am oil, they won’t even leave the factory type of thing, whereas in America people are trying to avoid going to work at all.” Musk’s comment comes as Tesla’s massive Shanghai “Giga-factory” pushes its workers to the limit to meet production targets amid an ongoing pandemic lockdown. In April, Tesla restricted its Shanghai workers from leaving the factory under a so-called “closed-loop” system originally developed by Chinese authorities to contain Beijing Olympics participants. While locked inside, the workers were reportedly made to work 12-hour shifts, six days in a row, and to sleep on factory floors. Production at the plant was forced to halt this week due to parts shortages, the company said. Labor rights and safety violations have been reported at Tesla’s Shanghai factory since it opened in 2018, with some workers making as little as $1,500 a month in what an investigation by local journalists called the “Giga-sweatshop.” Even in the United States, Musk is well known for his disregard for labor norms and work-life balance: the tech billionaire infamously declared “nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week”. He has bragged about making Tesla’s US employees work 100-hour weeks, while claiming to have worked 120-hour weeks himself. In March, Musk called an all-hands meeting for his other company, SpaceX, at 1am. These practices are on par with China’s extreme work culture, nicknamed “996”, in which workers are expected to work from 9am to 9pm, six days a week. The practice has been the source of protests in recent years and has been characterized as a form of modern slavery. Eli Friedman, a China labor expert and associate professor of international and comparative labor at Cornell University’s ILR School, said Musk’s remark should be understood in the “broader context of American corporations taking advantage not just of the low cost of labor in China, but the flexibility”. For bosses like Musk, “that’s the comparative advantage: the fact that you have hundreds of thousands of workers that you can literally wake up in the middle of the night and put them on the production line,” Friedman said. “It’s tapping into a kind of Orientalist narrative about these kind of robotic Chinese workers who, [Musk] says in a sort of valorized way, that this is a good thing,” the researcher added. Officially, Chinese labor law mandates a 40-hour work week, with employees allowed up to 36 hours of overtime a month – which would come out to just over a 48-hour work week. But that’s not what happens in practice. “There’s no pretence anywhere that that’s enforced,” said Friedman. “Excessive overtime is kind of a built-in feature of the whole model of industrial development in China. Very long hours and compulsory overtime, while not legal, are also completely the norm. And this is done regularly in consultation with local governments who are also tasked with enforcing the labor law.” Employees in China are often asked to sign a “striver’s pledge” which waives their right to overtime pay and paid time off. And while many corporations in China have unions, the unions are funded by the employer, which makes them essentially powerless to negotiate against management, Friedman noted. Tesla did not respond to questions about its factory’s work hours and policies. China’s gruelling culture of extreme hours has been celebrated by tech billionaires in the country, including Alibaba’s Jack Ma, who has called the “996” system a “huge blessing”, and rival company JD.com’s Richard Liu, who has called workers who work fewer hours “slackers”. In recent years, a growing movement of Chinese workers has stood up to oppose overwork, with some activists using tools like GitHub to compile lists of Chinese companies accused of violating labor laws. Anger over the country’s extreme work culture intensified last January after a 22-year-old worker for Shanghai-based e-commerce firm Pinduoduo collapsed and died after leaving work at 1.30am, after a run of brutally long shifts. Incidents like these helped drive a trend among young Chinese social media users early last year promoting “tang ping”, or “lying flat” as a passive protest against work, which has since been restricted on the Chinese internet. Later in the year, China’s top court ruled that forced and excessive overtime was illegal, but the ruling has not been well enforced. Work stoppages, often unofficial “wildcat” strikes, continue to occur regularly in China. Chinese and American labor norms have clashed in recent years, as bosses pit teams against each other. The 2019 Netflix documentary “American Factory” described the conflicts that arose after a Chinese billionaire, Cao Dewang, opened a factory in an abandoned General Motors plant in Ohio. “American workers are not efficient, and output is low,” Cao complained at one point in the film. “I can’t manage them.” Last week, the Wall Street Journal revealed that some of the US-based employees at Chinese-owned TikTok were expected to pull back-to-back all-nighters and spend as many as 85 hours a week in meetings to keep up with their Chinese colleagues. In the United States, employees covered by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act must receive overtime pay for working more than 40 hours a week. But the law places no cap on the number of hours an employee can work. The grim backdrop to Musk’s comments is that “American workers are in a very subjugated position as well, unfortunately”, said Friedman. “The not-at-all subtle threat is that these Chinese workers are a threat to you white American workers. If you don’t meet that standard, then your jobs are on the line.”","“They won’t just be burning the midnight oil, they will be burning the 3am oil, they won’t even leave the factory type of thing, whereas in America people are trying to avoid going to work at all.” Musk’s comment comes as Tesla’s massive Shanghai “Giga-factory” pushes its workers to the limit to meet production targets amid an ongoing pandemic lockdown. Labor rights and safety violations have been reported at Tesla’s Shanghai factory since it opened in 2018, with some workers making as little as $1,500 a month in what an investigation by local journalists called the “Giga-sweatshop.” Even in the United States, Musk is well known for his disregard for labor norms and work-life balance: the tech billionaire infamously declared “nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week”.

95,95,"TerraUSD, the “algorithmic stablecoin” whose collapse prompted a multibillion-dollar selloff across crypto markets, has turned off its blockchain and been delisted from major exchanges, in effect shuttering the project for good. However, the wider impact of the project’s failure appears to have been constrained. TerraUSD was once valued at more than $40bn (£33bn). Shockwaves swept through cryptocurrency markets on Thursday as tether, the largest stablecoin and a foundational part of the digital asset ecosystem, broke its peg to the dollar. On Friday, however, tether was back to within a fraction of a per cent of its $1 peg and has successfully processed more than $3bn worth of withdrawals without issue. Bitcoin and ethereum, the two most important cryptocurrencies, have recovered from their lows of early Thursday. Bitcoin is trading at above $30,000 a coin, up from $27,000, while Ethereum is at $2,000, up from $1,700. Both remain far below where they were trading at the start of the week. Terra’s failure is likely to topple more dominoes, warned Fitch Ratings. “The failure of Terra’s peg has sent shocks through the decentralised finance sector, with a key saving and lending protocol, Anchor, seeing massive liquidation of UST-collateralised loans and the pricing of other crypto tokens also being affected,” the company said. “This has led to further liquidation triggers throughout the ecosystem … Bouts of volatility will probably continue as the crypto sector digests the repercussions of the failure of the UST peg.” Stablecoins are intended to maintain a fixed value, typically $1 a coin. But some, such as Terra, are “algorithmic” stablecoins, which maintain that price through a promise to print or destroy currency to match demand. That approach has been criticised as sharing elements with a Ponzi scheme, requiring regular inflows of new capital to maintain the peg, and prone to a “death spiral” if investors lose confidence. That death spiral has left Terra’s two tokens effectively valueless. UST, the stablecoin, is now trading at under 20¢, far from its dollar peg; and Luna, the freely floating token that is supposed to provide the backing for the algorithmic stability, has fallen from $81 a coin seven days ago to $0.00004 a coin. The death spiral was worsened on Friday morning, when the key players behind Terra agreed to disable the blockchain that makes the system work, leaving the remaining holders unable to receive rewards for participation. At the same time, cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance and FTX moved to limit trading of the token, in an effort to protect naive investors from further losses. That was too late for some. The video game influencer KSI bought more than $3m worth of Luna on Tuesday, saying he had “always been a risk taker… I saw an opportunity and I had to take it.” His holdings are now worth less than $10. Despite the crash, the UK government says it aims to make stablecoins a legal part of the country’s payments infrastructure. “Our ambition is to make Britain a global hub for crypto-asset technology,” a Treasury spokesperson said , “by creating a regulatory environment where firms can invest, innovate and scale up, while maintaining financial stability and regulatory standards to ensure people can use new technologies reliably and safely. “We are delivering on this ambition – by consulting on a future regulatory regime for crypto-assets, legislating to bring stablecoins into payments regulation, and exploring ways of enhancing the competitiveness of the UK tax system to encourage further development of the crypto-asset market in the UK.”","“The failure of Terra’s peg has sent shocks through the decentralised finance sector, with a key saving and lending protocol, Anchor, seeing massive liquidation of UST-collateralised loans and the pricing of other crypto tokens also being affected,” the company said. “This has led to further liquidation triggers throughout the ecosystem … Bouts of volatility will probably continue as the crypto sector digests the repercussions of the failure of the UST peg.” Stablecoins are intended to maintain a fixed value, typically $1 a coin.

96,96,"Elon Musk has cast further doubt over his $44bn (£35bn) takeover of Twitter after stating the deal “cannot move forward” until the social media company proves that less than 5% of its users are fake or spam accounts. The Tesla chief executive used his Twitter account to say the agreed deal would not progress until the firm showed proof that only a small proportion of its users were fake. “My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate. Yesterday, Twitter’s CEO publicly refused to show proof of &lt;5%. This deal cannot move forward until he does.” Twitter said within hours of Musk’s latest tweet that it remained committed to the deal, as it filed new details on the transaction with the US financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Twitter is committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price and terms as promptly as practicable,” the company said. Musk announced last week that the deal was “on hold” after he queried Twitter’s claim in SEC filings that a small proportion of its users were fake or spam. The Twitter chief executive, Parag Agrawal, attempted to address Musk’s concerns in a lengthy tweet thread on Monday but his efforts to explain the problem “with the benefit or data, facts, and context” were met with a poo emoji from the world’s richest person. Musk’s latest tweet will add to speculation that he is preparing to walk away from the deal, which could trigger a $1bn break fee payable to Twitter, or attempt to strike a new takeover agreement at a price lower than the agreed $54.20 a share. Twitter shares, which have been affected by speculation that the deal might founder, were trading at $37.39 on Tuesday. Fake or spam accounts, known as bot accounts, are automated and not run by human users. They may use the reply function or direct messages to send adverts or scams to users, or represent attempts to influence public discourse by tweeting political propaganda. Other fake accounts exist purely to boost the metrics of individual users, who can buy followers, likes and retweets from bot sellers who control thousands or millions of fake accounts. Because they also inflate Twitter’s daily user numbers – 229m currently – they also pose a threat to the company’s advertising revenue, which accounts for 90% of its income. However, Twitter has consistently made clear in its quarterly statements since 2014 that it estimates its spam account problem to represent less than 5% of its users. Agrawal replied to Musk’s concerns publicly on Monday with a lengthy thread in which he explained the company’s methodology. Agrawal explained that tackling automated spam accounts was a “dynamic” process that required fighting “sophisticated and hard to catch” actors. He added that some accounts that had the characteristics of spam accounts were in fact operated by real people. “The hard challenge is that many accounts which look fake superficially are actually real people. And some of the spam accounts which are actually the most dangerous – and cause the most harm to our users – can look totally legitimate on the surface,” he wrote. He added that estimating Twitter’s fake account numbers could not be done externally because the process required access to sensitive data such as IP addresses and phone numbers. On Monday, Musk suggested he could seek to pay a lower price for Twitter because of the fake accounts issue. Speaking virtually at a conference in Miami, he said reducing his agreed $54.20 a share offer would not be “out of the question”. However, the terms of Musk’s takeover agreement with Twitter gave him only limited room for manoeuvre, legal experts said.","This deal cannot move forward until he does.” Twitter said within hours of Musk’s latest tweet that it remained committed to the deal, as it filed new details on the transaction with the US financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

97,97,"Why do billionaires tweet? Is it because they no longer have to earn a living? Or because they’re bored? Or because they spend a lot of time in, er, the smallest room in the mansion? Elon Musk, for example, currently the world’s richest fruitcake, has said that “At least 50% of my tweets were made on a porcelain throne”, adding that “it gives me solace”. This revelation motivated the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson to do some calculations, leading to the conclusion that more than 8,000 tweets over 12.5 years suggests that, on average, Musk “poops” twice a day. (I make it 1.75 a day, but that’s just quibbling.) So why does Musk tweet so much? One explanation is that he just can’t help himself. He has, after all, revealed that he has Asperger’s. “Look, I know I sometimes say or post strange things,” he said on Saturday Night Live, “but that’s just how my brain works”. Understood. It may also be a partial explanation of his business success, because his mastery of SpaceX and Tesla suggests not only high intelligence but also an ability to focus intensely on exceedingly complex problems without being distracted by other considerations. There are, however, darker interpretations – shared, it seems by the US Securities and Exchange Commission – that some of his tweeting is not, as it were, involuntary but is aimed at manipulating stock markets. Exhibit A: his announcement on 4 April that he had acquired a 9.2% stake in Twitter sent its shares rocketing upwards – from $39.31 to $49.97 – which meant the value of his holding went from $2.9bn to $3.5bn, giving him a notional profit of $600m in a single day. Nice work if you can get it, eh? Exhibit B: on 26 April he agrees to buy the company, whose shares were trading at $49.68 that day, for $54.20 a share, which leads Wall Street to conclude that he was paying too much. Then (exhibit C), on 13 May he announces that he is “pausing” his bid pending investigation of Twitter’s estimate of the prevalence of spam bots on the platform – and the share price tumbles, confirming Wall Street’s view of its overvaluation, but also suggesting that Musk is trying to find a way of wriggling out of what is now beginning to look like a foolish deal. And if that proves impossible for legal reasons, stand by for a torrent of tweets portraying himself as a victim. Where the truth lies in all this is unknowable, at least to a humble columnist, but the thing to keep hold of is that it’s all been driven by Musk’s tweets. There’s method somewhere in the madness, in other words. On one thing we can all agree, though, is that Musk is sui generis. What then about another insanely rich guy – also obsessed with space exploration – Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder? He bought the venerable Washington Post newspaper in August 2013 for what was effectively small change – $250m. This had the useful side-effect of infuriating Donald Trump. More importantly, it secured the paper’s future. And, as far as we can tell, Bezos doesn’t seem to be driving the Post’s editorial agenda. Yet Bezos, too, seems to have a tweeting problem. Last week, for example, Joe Biden published an anodyne tweet saying “You want to bring down inflation? Let’s make sure the wealthiest corporations pay their fair share.” Up pops Bezos, saying “the newly created Disinformation [Governance] Board should review this tweet, or maybe they need to form a new Non Sequitur Board instead. Raising corp taxes is fine to discuss. Taming inflation is critical to discuss. Mushing them together is just misdirection.” He followed this with what can only be described as a sermonette in Twitter-speak: “In fact, the administration tried hard to inject even more stimulus into an already over-heated, inflationary economy and only Manchin [Joe, the coal-brokerage founder who is also a senator representing West Virginia] saved them from themselves. Inflation is a regressive tax that most hurts the least affluent. Misdirection doesn’t help the country.” So why is Bezos wasting his time on Twitter? I can only think of two reasons: one bad and one good. The bad one is that he’s bored not running Amazon any more and needs to do some virtue-signalling just to show Musk (and the Twitterverse) that other billionaires are available. Though, as Politico’s Jack Shafer puts it: “Twitter fulminations may give Bezos a rush of ego-gratification, but why should the man who owns an entire dairy get such a kick out of sipping from a personal-sized milk carton?” The more charitable interpretation is that, unlike most proprietors of newspapers, he’s not using the Post as his personal megaphone and using Twitter to indulge his inner child. Like Musk but without the porcelain, in other words. So at least any war between the two of them won’t be a game of thrones. What I’ve been reading A strange breed Life among the Econ.

98,98,"Tether, the multibillion dollar “stablecoin” that functions as the largest bank in the cryptocurrency economy, has paid out $10bn (£8bn) in withdrawals since the crypto crash started in early May. The pace of withdrawals means the company is effectively dealing with a slow-motion bank run, as depositors seek to move their cash to more heavily regulated stablecoins. According to public blockchain records, $1bn of tether was redeemed – with the cryptocurrency handed back to the company and destroyed as part of the withdrawal process – just after midnight on Saturday. $1.5bn had already been redeemed the same way three days earlier. The total withdrawn is now, allowing for minor fluctuations in the stablecoin’s peg, about one-eighth of the entire reserves of the company. The latest redemption comes after Tether published its latest statement of reserves, which show that as of late March the company had backed user deposits with a mixture of US Treasury bills, bonds in other private companies, and about $5bn in miscellaneous “other investments”, including in other cryptocurrency enterprises. However, some have questioned whether the accounts are as reassuring for depositors as they appear. If the company’s investments in cryptocurrency enterprises fell in value during the market crash, then it may have struggled to match customer deposits, one fintech analyst has argued. Like all stablecoins, the tether currency is supposed to always be worth a fixed amount – in this case, one US dollar. It achieves that, the company says, by maintaining a large reserve of stable assets: while retail investors can buy or sell tether on cryptocurrency exchanges, institutional investors can also simply pay money directly to Tether to receive newly minted tokens, and can return the tokens to the company in exchange for cash. Initially, Tether claimed its reserves were backed one to one with US dollars. However, after an investigation by the New York attorney general, the company admitted that was not always the case and said that its currency was simply backed by “Tether’s reserves”. As part of that settlement, it agreed to publish a quarterly statement that detailed what those reserves comprise. The latest statement, dated before the recent crypto crash, shows Tether storing about $20bn of its cash in commercial paper, $7bn in money market funds and nearly $40bn in US Treasury bills, all of which are generally stable investments. Another $7bn, however, is stored in “corporate bonds, funds and precious metals”, and “other investments (including digital tokens)”. As a portion of Tether’s reserves, it is comparably small, but it opens the company up to the risk of breaking its promise to be “fully backed” should a large market fluctuation occur. That may already have happened, said Patrick McKenzie, a fintech commentator who works for the payments company Stripe. According to Tether’s company accounts, it has $162m more in reserves than the total outstanding tokens it has issued, McKenzie noted. But, to list just one public investment from the company, some of the digital tokens Tether holds are those of crypto investment platform Celsius. “Tether has invested $62.8m of the reserves into Celsius network … Celsius is in freefall due to the current market dislocation; the value of their native token is down by over 86%,” said McKenzie, adding: “Clearly, that investment has suffered more than $20m in impairment. Impairment of 1% of one line item on their balance sheet ate more than 10% of their equity.” In a statement, Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s chief technology officer, said: “Tether has maintained its stability through multiple black swan events and highly volatile market conditions and, even in its darkest days, Tether has never once failed to honour a redemption request from any of its verified customers. “This latest attestation further highlights that tether is fully backed and that the composition of its reserves is strong, conservative, and liquid.” • This article was amended on 23 May 2022 to refer more accurately to Tether’s latest statement of reserves rather than its audited accounts, as they have not been audited.","The latest redemption comes after Tether published its latest statement of reserves, which show that as of late March the company had backed user deposits with a mixture of US Treasury bills, bonds in other private companies, and about $5bn in miscellaneous “other investments”, including in other cryptocurrency enterprises.

99,99,"The UK’s data watchdog has fined a facial recognition company £7.5m for collecting images of people from social media platforms and the web to add to a global database. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) also ordered US-based Clearview AI to delete the data of UK residents from its systems. Clearview AI has collected more than 20bn images of people’s faces from Facebook, other social media companies and from scouring the web. John Edwards, the UK information commissioner, said Clearview’s business model was unacceptable. “Clearview AI Inc has collected multiple images of people all over the world, including in the UK, from a variety of websites and social media platforms, creating a database with more than 20bn images,” he said. “The company not only enables identification of those people, but effectively monitors their behaviour and offers it as a commercial service. That is unacceptable. That is why we have acted to protect people in the UK by both fining the company and issuing an enforcement notice.” The ICO, which conducted the investigation in tandem with its Australian counterpart, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, had announced a “provisional” intention to fine Clearview AI £17m last November. The ICO said on Monday it had reduced the fine after taking into consideration a number of factors including representations from the company. The £7.5m final sum is the third largest ever imposed by the ICO. Announcing its provisional decision last year, the ICO said Clearview AI’s technology had been offered on a “free trial basis” to UK law enforcement agencies, although that trial has been discontinued. Clearview AI’s services are no longer being offered in the UK – where previous clients included the Metropolitan police and the National Crime Agency – but the ICO said on Monday it still had customers abroad, so it was still using the data of UK residents. The ICO did not disclose the number of UK facial images held by Clearview AI, but said the company had harvested a “substantial” amount of data. Clearview AI customers can upload an image of a person to the company’s app, which is then checked against a database.

The ICO said Clearview AI broke UK data protection laws in several ways, including: failing to use information of UK residents in a fair and transparent way; failing to have a lawful reason for collecting that information; and failing to have a process in place to stop the data being retained indefinitely. It said Clearview AI asked for additional information from people, including photos, when they contacted the company to ask if they were on the database. The ICO said this may have put off people who wished to object about their presence on the database. Last week Clearview agreed to permanently stop selling access to its face database to private businesses or individuals around the US. The New York-based company will continue offering its services to federal agencies, such as US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and to other law enforcement agencies and government contractors outside Illinois, where the lawsuit was brought. Hoan Ton-That, Clearview AI’s chief executive, said: “I am deeply disappointed that the UK Information Commissioner has misinterpreted my technology and intentions … I would welcome the opportunity to engage in conversation with leaders and lawmakers so the true value of this technology, which has proven so essential to law enforcement, can continue to make communities safe.”","That is why we have acted to protect people in the UK by both fining the company and issuing an enforcement notice.” The ICO, which conducted the investigation in tandem with its Australian counterpart, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, had announced a “provisional” intention to fine Clearview AI £17m last November. Clearview AI’s services are no longer being offered in the UK – where previous clients included the Metropolitan police and the National Crime Agency – but the ICO said on Monday it still had customers abroad, so it was still using the data of UK residents.

100,100,"Terra, the “algorithmic stablecoin” project whose collapse this month prompted a widespread crash of the entire cryptocurrency sector, is being rebooted as “terra 2.0” in a last-ditch attempt to recover investor losses. However, the new cryptocurrency, which will be launched on Friday morning, will no longer involve any effort to peg its value to the US dollar, in an attempt to avoid the “death spiral” that destroyed the original iteration. The plans were approved by a vote of terra investors, with 65% voting in favour. Instead, new tokens will be handed out to a broad selection of users who were involved with “terra classic” before and after the crash. The largest portion of the tokens will be given to people who owned the terra stablecoin or its floating sister currency, Luna, as of 7 May, shortly before terra broke its peg with the US dollar and both currencies’ values spiralled towards zero. As of Wednesday the value of terra had fallen from $1 to nine cents. The primary goal of the reboot is to ensure that those users, who lost the most money in the crash, have a chance at redemption. A further quarter of the tokens will be given to those users who hold terra or Luna on Friday morning, in an effort to ensure they are rewarded for their loyalty, if they held it throughout the crash, or for providing exit capital to those who were trying to sell. Terra’s founder, the charismatic but controversial South Korean entrepreneur Do Kwon, said the motivation for rebooting the currency was to support the wider platform that had built up around terra. “While UST [the terra stablecoin] has been the central narrative of terra’s growth story over the last year, the distribution of UST has led to the development of one of the strongest developer ecosystems in crypto,” Kwon said. “The terra ecosystem and its community are worth preserving. Terra’s app ecosystem contains hundreds of developers working on everything from defi to fungible labour markets, state-of-the-art infrastructure and community experience. Although distressed, [terra has] strong brand recognition and a name that almost everyone in the world will have heard about.” But the relaunch does not guarantee that anyone will actually see a return. If distressed investors, such as the Ukrainian man who lost his entire $10,000 life savings in the crash, are to recover some of their wealth that will require others to be willing to buy in to the rebooted currency.","The largest portion of the tokens will be given to people who owned the terra stablecoin or its floating sister currency, Luna, as of 7 May, shortly before terra broke its peg with the US dollar and both currencies’ values spiralled towards zero.

101,101,"Dyson has signalled it is placing a “big bet” on producing robots capable of household chores by 2030, as it looks to move beyond the vacuum cleaners, fans and dryers that made its founder one of the wealthiest British businessmen. The company, founded by billionaire Sir James Dyson, on Wednesday published photographs of robot arms being used in household settings, including cleaning furniture, a claw picking up plates, and a hand-like machine picking up a teddy bear. While those may not sound like major achievements, robots still struggle with many actions that represent simple tasks for humans, such as grasping fragile objects or dealing with unfamiliar obstacles. Solving those and other problems could create new markets for the company. Dyson wants to build the UK’s largest robotics research centre at its Hullavington Airfield site, close to its design centre in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. However, other recruits will also be based in a London laboratory as well as in Singapore. James Dyson, whose net worth is £23bn, according to the Sunday Times, controversially moved the company’s HQ to Singapore in early 2019 despite championing the prospects of Britain’s manufacturing industry after Brexit, which he backed prominently. The Hullavington site had been planned as the location to develop an electric car. However, despite initially believing its car could be Dyson’s next big product, the effort was abandoned at the prototype stage because of concerns over profitability. Dyson, which made revenues of £6bn and profits before various costs of £1.5bn in 2021, had said it would spend £2.75bn from 2020 to 2025 – including £600m this year – to launch new products and research technologies, including robotics and batteries. Dyson announced at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation in Philadelphia that 2,000 people have joined it in 2022, half of which are engineers. It said it plans to recruit a further 700 robotics engineers in fields such as computer vision, machine learning, sensors and mechatronics over the next five years. Robots are widely used in controlled situations such as on factory production lines, but have yet to break into homes in any significant way beyond the niche but growing market for robotic vacuum cleaners. Dyson has already launched several robotic vacuums in the past, although its bestsellers remain cordless handheld models. Jake Dyson, the son of the founder who now works as the company’s chief engineer, said: “This is a ‘big bet’ on future robotic technology that will drive research across the whole of Dyson, in areas including mechanical engineering, vision systems, machine learning and energy storage.”","Dyson has signalled it is placing a “big bet” on producing robots capable of household chores by 2030, as it looks to move beyond the vacuum cleaners, fans and dryers that made its founder one of the wealthiest British businessmen.

102,102,"Sheryl Sandberg announced on Wednesday she will step down from her role as chief operating officer of Facebook, after 14 years as one of the most powerful figures at a company that transformed Silicon Valley. During her time at Facebook, now Meta, she saw the company through a meteoric rise and an ongoing storm of controversies. Sandberg herself transformed into a controversial figurehead for corporate feminism following the release of her book Lean In, which became a seminal manifesto for women in the workplace. Facebook, with Sandberg as one of its most public faces, has weathered scrutiny over the Cambridge Analytica breach, the January 2021 attack on the US Capitol, and most recently documents leaked by the whistleblower Frances Haugen that revealed some of the platform’s most toxic impacts. While the scandals have created a mixed legacy for the executive, her mark on the business of Facebook – and the entirety of the social media industry – is undeniable, said Debra Williamson an analyst at Insider Intelligence who has been following the company since its founding. “There have been plenty of controversies surrounding Meta, but from a purely business standpoint, what she built at Facebook is pretty powerful, and will go down in the history books,” she said. Sandberg joined Facebook four years after its founding to be “the adult in the room” of a young company and strategize the monetization of its growing user base. She helped revolutionize its advertising business model, turning the company into the juggernaut it is today at $117bn in revenue in 2021. In 2008, when she began, its yearly revenue was just $200m, according to Insider Intelligence. The scandals that took place during her tenure led activists to call for her resignation in recent years, and put into question her legacy as a women’s rights leader. Under Sandberg’s watch, Meta platforms became “a rightwing playground where misogyny, racism, disinformation” proliferated, said Shaunna Thomas, co-founder of women’s rights group UltraViolet. “Sheryl Sandberg may fancy herself a feminist, but her decisions at Meta made social media platforms less safe for women, people of color, and the American electoral system,” Thomas said. “Sandberg had the power to take action for 14 years, yet consistently chose not to.” She will be remembered not only for her business legacy, but also her time as a public figure for the company, said Scott Galloway, a professor at the New York University Stern School of Business. Sandberg has on a number of occasions testified in front of Congress to answer for Facebook’s missteps, taking the stand to deflect blame from the company for the Capitol riots and allegations of voter manipulation in 2016 and acting as a softer and more personable foil to the stoic CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. “Her primary role has been the most effective and expensive likability shield in history,” Galloway said. “Through her, Facebook invented what I call a nuclear weapon of mass distraction.” In her absence, there are likely going to be more public statements from up-and-coming Meta officials, including its head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, and Instagram CEO, Adam Clegg. Meanwhile, the issues at the root of congressional inquiries and public outrage are not likely to change following Sandberg’s departure, according to the hate speech watchdog group Media Matters for America. “Hard to imagine, but Facebook is about to get even worse and much more dangerous,” Media Matters for America said in a statement. In his response to her resignation, Zuckerberg has announced a new focus on building a content team that will rely more heavily on artificial intelligence – running in opposition to advocates’ recommendations that the company invest more heavily in human moderators. That shift comes as Meta makes an even broader pivot away from the social media business and into the virtual reality space. The company rebranded in October 2021 from Facebook to Meta as Zuckerberg invested billions of dollars into the “metaverse”, an augmented and virtual reality space where people can interact through avatars in a shared world. The metaverse venture comes as new privacy measures from Apple upended advertising systems central to the company’s revenue model, an issue Sandberg worked with closely, said Williamson. “This is the end of an era – and probably a good reason why Sheryl decided this was time to leave. Facebook is needing to build the next advertising and business infrastructure, and that’s a huge challenge,” she said. “And one that someone else will have to take on.”","Facebook, with Sandberg as one of its most public faces, has weathered scrutiny over the Cambridge Analytica breach, the January 2021 attack on the US Capitol, and most recently documents leaked by the whistleblower Frances Haugen that revealed some of the platform’s most toxic impacts.

103,103,"Elon Musk is considering a hiring freeze and job cuts of up to 10% of staff at Tesla because he has a “super bad feeling” about the state of the economy, according to an internal email seen by Reuters. Tesla currently has about 5,000 job openings advertised worldwide, and 100,000 employees. The email was sent to Tesla executives late on Thursday with the subject line “pause all hiring worldwide”, and comes days after Musk ordered all employees to return to the office for at least 40 hours a week or face immediate termination. Tesla’s stock was down 3% after hours on the news. Neither the company nor Musk replied to requests for comment from the Guardian. So far, there has been no fall in demand for Tesla cars and other electric vehicles. The usual indicators of a downturn – including increasing dealer inventories and incentives in the US – have not materialised. However, Tesla’s stock has been hammered, falling 22% since the billionaire used his shares to finance a planned acquisition of Twitter, which now appears to have stalled. Anxiety about the global economy and the impact of China’s Covid-19 lockdown in Shanghai, where Tesla has a factory, have also weighed on the company’s share price. Some had speculated that Musk’s command to return to the office was a below-the-table effort to cut staffing levels. Tesla staff posted on message boards that their offices didn’t have the physical capacity to host all staff members full-time, after rapid expansion during the pandemic, with one asking for advice whether they should ignore the command or go in and work from the stairwell. “The more senior you are, the more visible must be your presence,” said Musk in the return-to-the-office email. “That is why I lived in the factory so much – so that those on the line could see me working alongside them. If I had not done that, Tesla would long ago have gone bankrupt.” In Germany, the IG Metall union has said it will support any worker who decides to continue working remotely. “Whoever does not agree with such one-sided demands and wants to stand against them has the power of unions behind them in Germany, as per law,” the district leader for the union told Reuters. Tesla has 4,000 workers in Germany. Musk’s email on job cuts came a day after the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced a total hiring freeze and confirmed it would also be rescinding already-accepted job offers. “This is not a decision we make lightly, but is necessary to ensure we are only growing in the highest-priority areas,” LJ Brock, the company’s chief people officer, wrote in a blogpost. “We always knew crypto would be volatile, but that volatility alongside larger economic factors may test the company, and us personally, in new ways.” In the letter sent to would-be employees who had not yet started at the company, Brock said Coinbase would offer a severance payment of two months’ salary. “We are also committing additional support via a dedicated talent hub to help provide high-quality job search benefits.” As well as the wider tech downturn, and a massive collapse in the cryptocurrency market that Coinbase’s chief executive has described as a “crypto winter”, the company is suffering the fallout of some expensive missteps. An NFT marketplace, launched in early May, came months after the peak of the market, and attracted just 150 transactions on its first day.","The email was sent to Tesla executives late on Thursday with the subject line “pause all hiring worldwide”, and comes days after Musk ordered all employees to return to the office for at least 40 hours a week or face immediate termination.

104,104,"Apple is taking on Klarna and ClearPay with a new “buy now, pay later” feature for iPhones, the company has announced at its worldwide developer conference. The company is also redesigning the iPhone’s lock screen, in the most substantial visual redesign the operating system for iPhones has received since the introduction of the iPhone X, and introducing a new version of the MacBook Air built around its M2 chip. Apple’s buy now, pay later offering will compete with companies like Klarna and ClearPay by letting users take out an interest-free four-month loan on any payments made using its Apple Pay service. It is also partnering with e-commerce platform Shopify to allow users to track the progress of their orders in the Apple Wallet app. The buy now, pay later feature will be limited to the US when iOS 16 arrives in the autumn. The company also revealed a redesigned MacBook Air with its new MagSafe charging port, and a physical design akin to the larger MacBook Pro computers – marking an end to the distinctive tapered shape that has defined the line until now. Also, like those larger computers, the MacBook Air features an HD camera inside a distinctive “notch” on the front of the screen. The new M2 chips are 40% faster than the previous generation, Apple said, but still run without the need for a fan and with an 18-hour battery life. The computers will ship with a USB charger with two ports, and will be available from next month with prices starting at $1,199. For many, the most important change announced at the event will be for their iPhone lock screens. Whereas currently users can only change their wallpaper, from this autumn they will be able to change the appearance of the clock, pin small widgets to the front screen and minimise notifications to the bottom of the screen. And they will be able to swipe through multiple lock screens, with different looks and functionality for different use cases – a work lock screen could pin emails and mute social media, for instance, while a weekend lock screen could have more casual pictures and hide communications from work. Craig Federighi, Apple’s head of software engineering, said the redesign introduced “an incredible set of new personalisation features that will make your experience feel fresh and incredibly you”. The new features will be available to older iPhones but are likely intended to work in concert with the forthcoming iPhone 14, which is rumoured to have an always-on display. Alongside the visual redesign, iOS 16 will include a number of other new features: The Messages app will allow users to edit, or even recall, iMessages sent in error. Dictation has been redesigned to make it easier to switch between dictating text and editing it with a keyboard. Live text will now work with video, letting users cut and paste text from a paused video still. Apple Maps lets users add multiple stops to a route, and sync them between iOS and Macs. A new “shared photo library” allows families to seamlessly bundle all their pictures taken together in one shared online library. “Safety Check” lets people leaving abusive relationships sever all access given to other people with one click. The Fitness app, once limited to users with an Apple Watch, will now be on iPhones too, tracking steps and movement. “Continuity camera” lets you use your iPhone as a webcam for any Mac computer. And, 12 years after it was first released, the iPad will get a Weather app in iPadOS 16.","The company is also redesigning the iPhone’s lock screen, in the most substantial visual redesign the operating system for iPhones has received since the introduction of the iPhone X, and introducing a new version of the MacBook Air built around its M2 chip.

105,105,"Elon Musk on Monday made his most viable threat yet to walk away from a $44bn deal to buy Twitter, accusing the company of committing a “material breach” by failing to disclose the number of bots on the platform. The letter was published on the website of the US financial watchdog on Monday. He had previously tweeted that the deal “cannot move forward” until the spam and fake account issue had been resolved. His move is the most concrete to suggest he may be reneging on his deal to purchase the social media platform and is the latest in a long and winding saga between the Tesla executive and the social media platform. So, how did we get here? In a 4 April filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Musk said he had bought up almost $3bn in Twitter shares, making him the platform’s largest shareholder with a 9.2% stake. (Shortly after, Vanguard group surpassed him, now owning 10.3% of the company, and remains the largest shareholder). On 5 April, Twitter announced Musk would be joining the board, a move that was quickly reversed when he declined the appointment and offered to buy the company outright and take it private. His offer was $44bn, or $54.20 a share – 38% higher than Twitter’s 1 April close. Scrambling, Twitter’s board was poised to implement a “poison pill” policy, which would allow existing shareholders to buy stocks at a substantial discount in order to dilute the holdings of new investors and prevent the sale. However, negotiations between Musk and the board appeared to change that – and a deal was approved on 25 April. “Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” Musk said in a statement posted to Twitter following the purchase. “Twitter has tremendous potential – I look forward to working with the company and users to unlock it,” he added. The deal went through – and was approved unanimously by Twitter’s board of directors – but a $44bn purchase does not happen overnight. The purchase has to be approved by regulators and shareholders, and was expected to close in late 2022. While the mechanics of the deal move forward, investors and analysts are holding their breath. Musk could still pull out at any time – though he would be charged a $1bn “break fee” for doing so. The richest man in the world, Musk is worth $218bn. Some signs pointed to Musk moving forward with the deal. On 25 May, filings revealed he had secured additional funding for the purchase that would allow him to complete the purchase while incurring minimal personal debt. Those filings revealed he has increased his personal funding of the purchase from $27.3bn to $33.5bn and secured an additional $6.25bn in equity financing. But tides changed just weeks later when on Monday his lawyers wrote to Twitter accusing it of refusing to provide sufficient information about the number of false users on the service after Musk requested additional numbers on 9 May. It said information provided on 1 June was insufficient. “Twitter’s latest offer to simply provide additional details regarding the company’s own testing methodologies, whether through written materials or verbal explanations, is tantamount to refusing Mr Musk’s data requests,” said the letter from US law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom. Such requests lay the groundwork for Musk to back out with fewer penalties, said Anat Alon-Beck, a business law professor at Case Western Reserve University. Merger agreements typically contain certain “covenants” between both parties between the signing of the merger agreement and the closing. Musk doesn’t have to close unless Twitter “shall have performed or complied, in all material respects, with its obligations required under this Agreement,” the agreement said, according to Alon-Beck. That includes an obligation to “furnish promptly to [Musk] all information concerning the business, properties and personnel of [Twitter] as may reasonably be requested in writing”. “He can keep asking Twitter for more information about their bot problem,” Alon-Beck said. “Eventually he’ll ask questions they won’t answer, and then he can walk away.”","Elon Musk on Monday made his most viable threat yet to walk away from a $44bn deal to buy Twitter, accusing the company of committing a “material breach” by failing to disclose the number of bots on the platform.

106,106,"Twitter has been ordered to hand over the personal information of a widely followed and anonymous pro-Labor account as part of a defamation lawsuit brought on by far-right figure Avi Yemini. The anonymous PRGuy17 Twitter was set up in March 2020, around the time the pandemic hit Australia, with a user picture of the Simpsons character Troy McClure. The account would often post content strongly supporting the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, and attempted to get pro-Labor messages trending on the site. The account has built up a strong following on the website, amassing more than 77,000 followers. Yemini, who said on his Rebel News website he has been blocked by the account, launched proceedings in the federal court in March against the account and tweets that he alleges were defamatory. Yemini has repeatedly said he wants the identity of the person behind the account to be revealed. Guardian Australia has sought the court documents outlining the case. In orders by consent on Tuesday, Justice Debbie Mortimer ordered Twitter to hand over the basic subscriber information, including the name of the account and email address at the date of registration, within 14 days. The orders also ask for the IP addresses associated with the account at the time of registration, as well as between the end of December last year and 11 February 2022, and between 21 March and 20 May this year. The orders by consent mean it was agreed by Twitter, which will comply with the order. Twitter has indicated in the past that it will only hand over subscriber information when required through court orders or other legal processes. It is not the first case of its kind where a tech platform has been ordered to hand over account information of anonymous users for the purposes of identifying who is behind the account for defamation action. Cases have been launched against Google in recent years to unmask people leaving anonymous reviews on businesses. If the basic account information doesn’t provide any clues as to the identity of the account owner, the IP addresses will be the next avenue of investigation. Unless the account owner used a virtual private network (VPN) at the time of logging into the account, the IP addresses will reveal which ISP or mobile provider the account used. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The telecommunications company is then usually brought before the court to provide information on who had the IP address at the time associated with the account. In 2020, Optus handed over information that revealed the identity of an anonymous negative reviewer on Melbourne dentist Dr Matthew Kabbabe’s page, after he took legal action. The case was subsequently settled. Digital Rights Watch program lead, Samantha Floreani, said it was too soon to determine what implications the case might have for anonymity online, but said it could re-ignite political desires to push social media companies to collect more personal information of users in order to be able to reveal their identity more readily. “I also worry about the message this sends to people watching the case unfurl,” she said. “It’s really important to remember that for many people the ability to be anonymous online is a vital safety mechanism and that it also plays a key role in protecting our right to privacy, freedom of speech, and people’s ability to participate in democracy."" “It’s easy to lose sight of the value of anonymity while caught up in an online frenzy about highly divisive internet personalities.” Yemini is also seeking donations via his website for a legal fund, while a recent crowdfunding campaign to “buy a beer” for PRGuy17, says it will cover “obtaining legal advice and security, living and general expenses”. It has raised over $18,000 so far. Guardian Australia has sought comment from PRGuy17.","The orders also ask for the IP addresses associated with the account at the time of registration, as well as between the end of December last year and 11 February 2022, and between 21 March and 20 May this year.

107,107,"Apple’s annual developer event, WWDC, is in full swing. “Dub Dub”, as it’s known, is about more than the company’s regular product launches, which are focused on the physical devices soon to hit store shelves – it is a chance for Tim Cook’s team to shape the conversation more broadly: focus attention where they want it, guide the eyes of the world to the next big thing, and steer developers towards working on the products and services necessary to enable the hardware still in the pipeline to flourish. In previous years, that has included a strong focus on augmented reality technology, encouraging developers to adopt the company’s tools for building AR experiences. That has had both a short-term and a long-term advantage: Apple has included increasingly advanced Lidar sensors (think radar but with light) on iPhones and iPads, capable of mapping a room in fine detail. In the long term, it’s meant there’s a community of developers capable of working with the technology that Apple will use in its much-rumoured AR glasses. This year, we saw similar approaches across the board. The company showed off a new lock screen for the iPhone, that lets users customise far more than just the wallpaper, from the font used for the clock to the placement and location of widgets on the lock screen itself. (We will now take a brief pause while the Android users in the audience point out that they’ve had this for years.) The changes will be useful from day one and be a clear advantage in three months when, if supply-chain leaks are accurate, the latest iPhones will have an always-on display. That feature turning the lock screen from something you see briefly while waiting for Face ID to kick in to a near-permanent presence in your life if you, like many, have your phone face-up on a desk or table for vast chunks of the day. Yet sometimes that focus can be tiresome. When your wishlist is topped by minor feature updates and bug fixes to its current product, it can be wearying to find Apple instead driven by the relentless urge for growth to tackle another entirely new area. What’s less common is to find it actively worrying. But that’s the feeling I had as the focus of Monday’s keynote shifted from smart-home technology to updates for Apple’s CarPlay service for connected vehicles. Can’t drive, won’t drive I should preface this by saying that I don’t drive, so news about CarPlay serves less as a hype reel of the features that will be arriving in my car over the coming year, and more as a foreboding look at all the things that will be drawing drivers’ attention away from the important task of not hitting me as I cross the road. Through that lens, the CarPlay news was unsettling. “Cars have changed a lot,” said Emily Schubert, a senior manager in the company’s Car Experience team. “With larger-size screens and more of them throughout the car, there is an opportunity for iPhone to play an even more important role. We’ve been working with automakers to reinvent the in-car experience, across all of the driver’s screens.” Apple’s preview showed a car with a dizzying amount of information at the driver’s fingertips. As well as a digital speedometer and tachometer, and a turn-by-turn map updated in between them, the display stretched off into the distance along the dashboard: information about the current trip (including ETA and fuel economy); events in the calendar; the air quality and UV index of the local area; two analogue clocks; the fact that the home garage door was closed; and the song playing on the stereo. Underneath was a second screen, with yet more weather information, and a full-size display of app icons, including news, phone and messages. You can choose curated themes and styles for your gauges,” Schubert explained. “And automakers from around the world are excited to bring this new vision of CarPlay to customers.” I bet they are. The old joke was that cars were sold on the feel of the door slamming shut, rather than passenger safety or fuel economy; the new truth appears to be that more important than either of those are the size and shape of the in-car entertainment system – a fact that Apple is pleased to promote, noting that: “CarPlay is available on over 98% of cars in the US [and] 79% of US buyers would only consider a car that works with CarPlay.” But not one word of Schubert’s presentation addressed the safety ramifications of fitting ever-larger screens in cars, nor opening up a bevy of customisation options for users. (Apple sent me a holding email and ignored my questions asking if the company had researched the issue before embarking on development.) Safety over style For all that Tesla, which has pioneered the trend towards massive screens sitting in the central console of a vehicle, might wish otherwise, most cars do not yet drive themselves. But the more tasks that are shifted from buttons and dials to a touchscreen device, the less a driver is able to do while devoting their attention to the road ahead. A 2017 report from the American Automobile Association found that some tasks can be tremendously distracting: programming a navigation system took an average of 40 seconds, all of which left the driver unable to focus on the most important task at hand. “Just because a technology is available while driving does not mean it is safe or easy to use when behind the wheel. Drivers should only use these technologies for legitimate emergencies or urgent, driving-related purposes,” said Jake Nelson, the Automobile Association of America’s director of traffic safety advocacy and research. There are other small dangers that add up. A large backlit screen in front of your face poses new problems for night driving; a shift from tactile knobs and dials to smooth glass for air conditioning and other comfort features adds yet further reasons to glance away from the road. I don’t doubt that Apple does have a safety story to tell here. The company’s continued investment in Siri means that more tasks than ever can be performed without taking your eyes off the road. And it’s important to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good: a world without these screens is unlikely to be a world full of great, law-abiding drivers, but rather just a world where more people than ever are comfortable holding their phone in one hand as they drive with the other. But my priority for an in-car display is providing a driver with the information they need to get from A to B without endangering me, other road users, other drivers and themselves. To listen to Apple’s presentation, one could be forgiven for believing that the priority is to let drivers choose the colours for the speedometer. No, Elon A brief update on Musk: he continues to try not to buy Twitter, the company he offered $44bn (£35bn) to acquire in April with a goal of “defeating the spam bots”, because he apparently worries there might be a lot of spam bots on the social network: Musk’s lawyers have written to Twitter accusing it of refusing to provide sufficient information about the number of false users on the service, as part of a simmering dispute over the number of spam and fake accounts that populate the platform. The Tesla boss explicitly waived the right to due diligence as part of his offer, which once seemed as if it was progressing at record pace. But in late May, around the time of a widespread crash in tech stocks that affected Musk’s own holdings as well as those of other social networks, he seemed to develop a sudden deeply held belief that Twitter had lied about the number of fake accounts on the site, which the company had already claimed hovered at around 5%. Now, Twitter is providing him with grounds to walk away from the deal entirely, Musk argues. Whether Musk wants to back out, or merely renegotiate the deal for better terms, is unclear, but it’d take a very trusting person to believe that he was genuinely surprised by fake accounts and changed his mind. Whether or not the courts buy it – or Twitter folds before it even reaches a judge – is a different matter, of course. Will Musk’s record run of getting away with shit continue?

108,108,"Australian courts may not be able to enforce an order that Google pay John Barilaro more than $700,000 in defamation damages because of free speech protections in US law, legal academics say. Google, the owner of YouTube, was on Monday ordered to pay the former New South Wales deputy premier aggravated damages over a series of defamatory “racist” and “abusive” videos published on the YouTube channel Friendlyjordies. Federal court justice Stephen Rares ruled that Barilaro had been left “traumatised” by a campaign of “relentless cyberbullying” by comedian Jordan Shanks, who uses the nom de plume Friendlyjordies. Dr Damien Spry, an expert in social media impacts on politics and diplomacy, says there are a couple of “very powerful” American laws that protect US-based internet companies from defamation penalties. “The important point is Google can try to ignore the court ruling because US laws provide a shield US companies can use to hide behind,” Spry told Guardian Australia. “What Google is going to do is the big question, I think. “It’s quite consequential to agree. If Google abides by the court ruling, and that’s a big if, then they’ve kind of accepted local jurisdiction. “Obviously, they can afford to pay the money, but they can’t afford to be dragged into court over and over and over again.” Prof David Rolph, a media law expert at the University of Sydney, said the Barilaro case is the first time in Australia that YouTube as a platform has been held liable for a user’s content. But what happens next is uncertain because Australian courts don’t necessarily have the jurisdiction to enforce judgments against US-based companies. “Certainly in the US where these companies are based they have different defamation laws,” Rolph told Guardian Australia. “The difficulty is that you have these companies that operate throughout the world – that have pervasive technologies and platforms that pervade everyday life – but the question then becomes locally, is that particular multinational entity amenable to a local court’s jurisdiction? “And even if it is, when there’s a judgement that results from that proceeding, can you enforce the judgement?” Rolph said Google looked at the content Barilaro complained about and formed a view that there was nothing wrong with it, in line with their policies, and allowed it to stay up. But the high court in the Dylan Voller defamation case found that publishers could be held liable for allegedly defamatory comments on their social media pages. “The content policies of those large media companies are informed very much by first amendment values, which creates a tension with the laws that apply in other places around the world like Australia,” Rolph said. “And so that’s how you can have a situation where Google can look at content and conclude that it doesn’t violate their content policies. Just as Justice Rares looks at it and concludes that it’s very obviously defamatory.” Barilaro launched legal action against both Shanks and Google over two videos titled “bruz” and “Secret Dictatorship”, claiming they were “vile and racist” and brought him into “public disrepute, odium, ridicule and contempt”. The claim against Shanks was settled in November last year, with Shanks apologising for any hurt caused, editing parts of two videos and paying legal costs but not damages. Google initially defended the case, but withdrew all defences and conceded the videos defamed Barilaro. Spry says one of two things is going to happen in this landmark case. “Google Australia sees itself as being Google Australia and acts as Google Australia, and abides by Australian laws – or Google based in America says nothing and just refuses.” Justice Rares also referred the conduct of Shanks and Google to the principal registrar of the court to consider proceedings against them for “what appear to be serious contempts of court”. He said a Friendlyjordies video in December attacking the professional integrity of Barilaro’s legal team was a “splenetic and vindictive attack … calculated to bring improper pressure to intimidate each of them from continuing to act for Mr Barilaro”.","“Obviously, they can afford to pay the money, but they can’t afford to be dragged into court over and over and over again.” Prof David Rolph, a media law expert at the University of Sydney, said the Barilaro case is the first time in Australia that YouTube as a platform has been held liable for a user’s content. “The difficulty is that you have these companies that operate throughout the world – that have pervasive technologies and platforms that pervade everyday life – but the question then becomes locally, is that particular multinational entity amenable to a local court’s jurisdiction? “And even if it is, when there’s a judgement that results from that proceeding, can you enforce the judgement?” Rolph said Google looked at the content Barilaro complained about and formed a view that there was nothing wrong with it, in line with their policies, and allowed it to stay up. “Google Australia sees itself as being Google Australia and acts as Google Australia, and abides by Australian laws – or Google based in America says nothing and just refuses.” Justice Rares also referred the conduct of Shanks and Google to the principal registrar of the court to consider proceedings against them for “what appear to be serious contempts of court”.

109,109,"Bunnings, Kmart and The Good Guys have been using facial recognition technology in a bid to crack down on theft in-store, research by Choice says. The consumer group said it asked 25 of Australia’s largest retailers whether they were using facial recognition technology and examined their privacy policies. Based on that investigation, it said, the three appeared to be the only retailers among that group who were using the technology. Facial recognition technology captures images of people’s faces from video cameras – such as CCTV footage – as a unique faceprint that is then stored and can be compared with other faceprints. The privacy policy for The Good Guys says the cameras may capture an image of someone’s face to track the person through the store, and be retained to identify someone on future visits. The company says it is “strictly for the purposes of security and theft prevention and managing/improving customer experience at our stores”. According to Choice, Kmart and Bunnings have small signs on the stores where it is used. At Kmart it says “this store has 24-hour CCTV coverage, which includes facial recognition technology”. Both the Bunnings and Kmart privacy policies state the facial recognition technology is for “loss prevention or store safety purposes”. “The use of facial recognition by Kmart, Bunnings and The Good Guys is a completely inappropriate and unnecessary use of the technology,” Choice consumer data advocate Kate Bower said. “Discreet signage and online privacy policies are not nearly enough to adequately inform shoppers that this controversial technology is in use. The technology is capturing highly personal data from customers, including infants and children.” A spokesperson for Bunnings said the technology was used in select stores “to help prevent theft and support the safety of our team and customers” and was in line with the Privacy Act. “In recent years, we’ve seen an increase in the number of challenging interactions our team have had to handle in our stores and this technology is an important tool in helping us to prevent repeat abuse of team and customers,” he said. “We let customers know if the technology is in use through signage at our store entrances and also in our privacy policy, which is available on our website.” The Good Guys said facial recognition technology had been trialled in two stores to prevent theft and boost safety. The stores have signs at the entrance advising customers the technology is being used, a spokesperson said. Kmart said it was also trialling the technology “in a small number of stores” for loss prevention and safety. It said personal information would be kept private and protected in compliance with privacy law. Businesses are generally allowed to use CCTV to photograph customers on their premises, but Choice has raised concerns that privacy law has not kept pace with advances in facial recognition technology. A Choice survey released as part of the research found 78% of those surveyed had concerns about how their biometric data was being stored, while 75% were concerned companies might use the data to create customer profiles for marketing purposes. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Choice says it has notified the OIAC (Office of the Australian Information Commissioner) of its findings and asked it to determine whether the use of the technology is consistent with the Privacy Act. “Choice is concerned that Australian businesses are using facial recognition technology on consumers before Australians have had their say on its use in our community,” Bower said. Convenience store giant 7-Eleven last year disabled a feature in more than 700 in-store review tablets that the OAIC found had taken facial images of millions of customers who used the tablets to complete surveys without their consent. The company argued at the time that the images were used only to ensure multiple surveys were not conducted by the same person in one day and that it had destroyed the images. Kieran Pender, a senior lawyer with the Human Rights Law Centre , said the increasing use of facial technology raised human rights concerns. “Such technologies should only be used alongside robust safeguards that ensure the use is necessary, proportionate and subject to appropriate oversight,” he said. “The new Albanese government should prioritise the implementation of regulations governing facial recognition technologies as part of the forthcoming overhaul of the electronic surveillance framework.” A spokesperson for the OAIC said it would consider the findings.","The technology is capturing highly personal data from customers, including infants and children.” A spokesperson for Bunnings said the technology was used in select stores “to help prevent theft and support the safety of our team and customers” and was in line with the Privacy Act. “We let customers know if the technology is in use through signage at our store entrances and also in our privacy policy, which is available on our website.” The Good Guys said facial recognition technology had been trialled in two stores to prevent theft and boost safety.

110,110,"The “bloodbath” in the cryptocurrency sector may claim another victim, with the co-founder of multibillion dollar hedge fund Three Arrows Capital using Twitter in an attempt to battle rumours that the company is insolvent following the market collapse. With a net asset value of $18bn (£14.9bn) in its last public statement, the Singapore-based hedge fund was known for taking large, highly leveraged stakes in crypto businesses and cryptocurrencies directly. It holds positions in cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, as well as equity investments in companies such as the BlockFi exchange and options trading platform Deribit. The turmoil in the crypto markets has substantially reduced the value of those holdingsand wiped out some other stakes the fund, known as 3AC, has taken, including in doomed “algorithmic stablecoin” project Terra and “play-to-earn” game Axie Infinity, which was the victim of a $700m hack late last year, attributed to North Korean state-sponsored hackers. Zhu Su, the Dubai-based investor behind the crypto-focused trading house, tweeted on Wednesday morning that “we are in the process of communicating with relevant parties and fully committed to working this out”. With traders already nursing wounds after a 25% drop in the price of bitcoin in a single day, sparked by the announcement by ersatz crypto bank Celsius that it would be suspending withdrawals, Zhu’s statement kicked off a further day of turmoil in the crypto sector. Crypto exchange Binance’s chief executive, Changpeng Zhao, described the situation as a “bloodbath”. Bitcoin’s value continued to tumble on Wednesday, to just over $20,000, 70% below its record high of $69,000 in November. Tether, the centralised stablecoin which holds systemic importance to the wider cryptocurrency sector, published a statement denying any losses from 3AC or Celsius. “Celsius position has been liquidated with no losses to Tether,” the company said. “Tether’s lending activity with Celsius (as with any other borrower) has always been overcollateralized. Tether has currently zero exposure to Celsius apart from a small investment made out of Tether equity in the company.” The company had previously told the Financial Times that its loans to Celsius were 30% over-collateralised, meaning it had taken $1.30 in bitcoin for every $1 it lent out. Tether added: “Tether is aware of other rumours being spread, suggesting that it has lending exposure to Three Arrows Capital – again this is categorically false.” The company also dismissed claims that its large holdings of commercial paper – short-term loans to businesses – were held in disproportionately risky investments. It also said that it intended to replace those holdings with US Treasury bonds, though offered no date by which that switch was intended to have occurred. On Wednesday, the Tron DAO reserve project, which backs the USDD algorithmic stablecoin, announced it was withdrawing more than $100m worth of cryptocurrency from Binance in order to support the dollar peg of its stablecoin, which had slipped to $0.97 on crypto exchanges. That sparked fears that the stablecoin might follow in the footsteps of its similarly structured peer UST, the collapse of which precipitated the latest crisis. Teunis Brosens, head economist for digital finance at Dutch bank ING, said that while the run on cryptocurrencies could partly be explained by wider market conditions, the recent collapse of the Terra stablecoin project had sparked a deeper concern about the overall viability of some of the less well-known digital assets. “Crypto investors have grown very critical, especially about the more complex products, and want to get out. There may still be confidence in bitcoin and Ethereum, which are the more straightforward currencies, but as people scramble to get out of the complex products, entities like Celsius have to liquidate their conventional coins like bitcoin and Ethereum, which only depresses their price further.” On Tuesday evening, Bill Gates warned that the Crypto sector was a bubble economy, “100% based on greater fool theory”, the idea that profit comes from finding someone dumber than you to sell your asset to. “I’m used to asset classes … like a farm where they have output, or like a company where they make products,” Gates said.","The “bloodbath” in the cryptocurrency sector may claim another victim, with the co-founder of multibillion dollar hedge fund Three Arrows Capital using Twitter in an attempt to battle rumours that the company is insolvent following the market collapse.

111,111,"You’re at the wheel of your car but you’re exhausted. Your shoulders start to sag, your neck begins to droop, your eyelids slide down. As your head pitches forward, you swerve off the road and speed through a field, crashing into a tree. But what if your car’s monitoring system recognised the tell-tale signs of drowsiness and prompted you to pull off the road and park instead? The European Commission has legislated that from this year, new vehicles be fitted with systems to catch distracted and sleepy drivers to help avert accidents. Now a number of startups are training artificial intelligence systems to recognise the giveaways in our facial expressions and body language. These companies are taking a novel approach for the field of AI. Instead of filming thousands of real-life drivers falling asleep and feeding that information into a deep-learning model to “learn” the signs of drowsiness, they’re creating millions of fake human avatars to re-enact the sleepy signals. “Big data” defines the field of AI for a reason. To train deep learning algorithms accurately, the models need to have a multitude of data points. That creates problems for a task such as recognising a person falling asleep at the wheel, which would be difficult and time-consuming to film happening in thousands of cars. Instead, companies have begun building virtual datasets. Synthesis AI and Datagen are two companies using full-body 3D scans, including detailed face scans, and motion data captured by sensors placed all over the body, to gather raw data from real people. This data is fed through algorithms that tweak various dimensions many times over to create millions of 3D representations of humans, resembling characters in a video game, engaging in different behaviours across a variety of simulations. In the case of someone falling asleep at the wheel, they might film a human performer falling asleep and combine it with motion capture, 3D animations and other techniques used to create video games and animated movies, to build the desired simulation. “You can map [the target behaviour] across thousands of different body types, different angles, different lighting, and add variability into the movement as well,” says Yashar Behzadi, CEO of Synthesis AI. Using synthetic data cuts out a lot of the messiness of the more traditional way to train deep learning algorithms. Typically, companies would have to amass a vast collection of real-life footage and low-paid workers would painstakingly label each of the clips. These would be fed into the model, which would learn how to recognise the behaviours. The big sell for the synthetic data approach is that it’s quicker and cheaper by a wide margin. But these companies also claim it can help tackle the bias that creates a huge headache for AI developers. It’s well documented that some AI facial recognition software is poor at recognising and correctly identifying particular demographic groups. This tends to be because these groups are underrepresented in the training data, meaning the software is more likely to misidentify these people. Niharika Jain, a software engineer and expert in gender and racial bias in generative machine learning, highlights the notorious example of Nikon Coolpix’s “blink detection” feature, which, because the training data included a majority of white faces, disproportionately judged Asian faces to be blinking. “A good driver-monitoring system must avoid misidentifying members of a certain demographic as asleep more often than others,” she says. The typical response to this problem is to gather more data from the underrepresented groups in real-life settings. But companies such as Datagen say this is no longer necessary. The company can simply create more faces from the underrepresented groups, meaning they’ll make up a bigger proportion of the final dataset. Real 3D face scan data from thousands of people is whipped up into millions of AI composites. “There’s no bias baked into the data; you have full control of the age, gender and ethnicity of the people that you’re generating,” says Gil Elbaz, co-founder of Datagen. The creepy faces that emerge don’t look like real people, but the company claims that they’re similar enough to teach AI systems how to respond to real people in similar scenarios. There is, however, some debate over whether synthetic data can really eliminate bias. Bernease Herman, a data scientist at the University of Washington eScience Institute, says that although synthetic data can improve the robustness of facial recognition models on underrepresented groups, she does not believe that synthetic data alone can close the gap between the performance on those groups and others. Although the companies sometimes publish academic papers showcasing how their algorithms work, the algorithms themselves are proprietary, so researchers cannot independently evaluate them. In areas such as virtual reality, as well as robotics, where 3D mapping is important, synthetic data companies argue it could actually be preferable to train AI on simulations, especially as 3D modelling, visual effects and gaming technologies improve. “It’s only a matter of time until… you can create these virtual worlds and train your systems completely in a simulation,” says Behzadi. This kind of thinking is gaining ground in the autonomous vehicle industry, where synthetic data is becoming instrumental in teaching self-driving vehicles’ AI how to navigate the road. The traditional approach – filming hours of driving footage and feeding this into a deep learning model – was enough to get cars relatively good at navigating roads. But the issue vexing the industry is how to get cars to reliably handle what are known as “edge cases” – events that are rare enough that they don’t appear much in millions of hours of training data. For example, a child or dog running into the road, complicated roadworks or even some traffic cones placed in an unexpected position, which was enough to stump a driverless Waymo vehicle in Arizona in 2021. With synthetic data, companies can create endless variations of scenarios in virtual worlds that rarely happen in the real world. “Instead of waiting millions more miles to accumulate more examples, they can artificially generate as many examples as they need of the edge case for training and testing,” says Phil Koopman, associate professor in electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. AV companies such as Waymo, Cruise and Wayve are increasingly relying on real-life data combined with simulated driving in virtual worlds. Waymo has created a simulated world using AI and sensor data collected from its self-driving vehicles, complete with artificial raindrops and solar glare. It uses this to train vehicles on normal driving situations, as well as the trickier edge cases. In 2021, Waymo told the Verge that it had simulated 15bn miles of driving, versus a mere 20m miles of real driving. An added benefit to testing autonomous vehicles out in virtual worlds first is minimising the chance of very real accidents. “A large reason self-driving is at the forefront of a lot of the synthetic data stuff is fault tolerance,” says Herman. “A self-driving car making a mistake 1% of the time, or even 0.01% of the time, is probably too much.” In 2017, Volvo’s self-driving technology, which had been taught how to respond to large North American animals such as deer, was baffled when encountering kangaroos for the first time in Australia. “If a simulator doesn’t know about kangaroos, no amount of simulation will create one until it is seen in testing and designers figure out how to add it,” says Koopman. For Aaron Roth, professor of computer and cognitive science at the University of Pennsylvania, the challenge will be to create synthetic data that is indistinguishable from real data. He thinks it is plausible that we’re at that point for face data, as computers can now generate photorealistic images of faces. “But for a lot of other things,” – which may or may not include kangaroos – “I don’t think that we’re there yet.”","Instead of filming thousands of real-life drivers falling asleep and feeding that information into a deep-learning model to “learn” the signs of drowsiness, they’re creating millions of fake human avatars to re-enact the sleepy signals.

112,112,"The price of bitcoin has fallen below $20,000 (£16,400) amid deepening turmoil in the cryptocurrency market. The cornerstone digital asset slipped to levels not seen since December 2020 on Saturday morning, at one point going under $19,000 before recovering to about $19,160, according to CoinDesk. Bitcoin has now lost more than 70% of its value compared with the peak it reached last year. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been hit by several factors including rising inflation, which has prompted interest rate rises by central banks. This, in turn, has dampened investor appetite for riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies and has hit global stock markets, with the previously high-flying tech sector affected in particular. Last week the UK and US central banks raised rates in an attempt to quell rising prices, putting further pressure on digital assets. Cryptocurrency is the term for a group of digital assets that share the same underlying structure as bitcoin: a publicly available “blockchain” that records ownership without having any central authority in control. Crypto’s backers have said the sector represents a good investment because, for instance, it carries low fees and, unlike conventional currencies, is not tied to governments. However, its detractors say a lack of regulatory oversight or implicit government support, due to crypto and bitcoin’s independent origins, make it susceptible to scams and wild fluctuations in price. The crypto market, which trades on a 24-hour basis, is also suffering internal problems that began with the collapse of Terra, a so-called stablecoin whose value was supposed to be pegged to the dollar. Its failure in May shook faith in digital assets, triggering a wave of selling that has been exacerbated by the wider interest rate moves. The entire crypto market, worth more than $3tn in November last year, is now valued at $884bn, according to data firm CoinGecko. The investor panic also started to affect financial businesses focused on the crypto markets. Last week Celsius Network, a bank-like business that offered high rates of return on cryptocurrency deposits, stopped customer withdrawals. Then Three Arrows Capital, a hedge fund that made expensive bets on the crypto markets, admitted it was in trouble. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Friday, Three Arrows’ co-founder, Kyle Davies, said the firm was looking at asset sales or selling itself to another business. The $20,000 level is viewed as important by some crypto followers for a number of reasons. About half of all bitcoin wallets were sitting on profits at a price of just over $20,000 according to an analysis by the Columbia Business School in New York, cited by the New York Times. Last week, a crypto executive told Bloomberg that a fall below $20,000 might trigger more sell-offs because some financial firms have borrowed heavily to bet on a rising bitcoin price, but will have to liquidate their positions – in effect cutting their losses – if the currency falls below $20,000. “There are lot of funds, large borrowers of bitcoin, who have liquidation positions in $20,000 range,” said Bobby Lee, chief executive of the crypto storage company Ballet Global, in an interview with Bloomberg TV.","Cryptocurrency is the term for a group of digital assets that share the same underlying structure as bitcoin: a publicly available “blockchain” that records ownership without having any central authority in control.

Musk’s daughter also changed her gender recognition from male to female after turning 18, the age of consent in California. The documents were filed with the Los Angeles county superior court in Santa Monica in April and came to light recently in online media reports. Her new name was redacted in the online document. Her mother is Justine Wilson, who was married to Elon from 2000 to 2008, when she divorced him. Musk and Wilson have five children together. Musk also has two children with singer Grimes. Wilson said in a tweet on Tuesday she is proud of her daughter. She did not immediately respond to additional request for comment. Representatives for Musk’s daughter could not immediately be reached. There were no further details on the rift between Musk’s daughter and her father, the Tesla and SpaceX chief. Musk, the world’s richest man, is engaged in a high-profile, $44 bn bid to take over social media platform Twitter. On Tuesday, Twitter’s board unanimously recommended that shareholders approve the proposed sale, according to a regulatory filing. Musk reiterated his desire to move forward with the acquisition last week during a virtual meeting with Twitter employees, though the CEO has also indicated there are several “unresolved matters” related to the deal. In a statement to the Daily Beast, Musk criticized media outlets for publishing the story about his daughter and her name. “She does not want to be a public figure,” he said. “I think it is important to defend her right to privacy. Please don’t out someone against their will – it’s not right.” Musk did not immediately respond to additional request for comment. A hearing to finalize the name change will take place later this month.","Elon Musk’s 18-year-old daughter has legally changed her name to disassociate herself from her billionaire father, legal filings that came to light Monday show. “I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form,” she said in a petition for both a name change and a new birth certificate.

115,115,"An annoyance, an important security feature, an uncomfortable existential request: however you feel about being asked to prove you are not a robot, it has become a daily occurrence for most of us, but perhaps not one we would miss. A new feature in the upcoming versions of iOS and macOS, Apple’s operating systems for iPhones and computers, promises to give the boot to “captchas” once and for all. Called “automatic verification”, the technology will allow sites to verify you are not a robot without you having to do anything at all. Captchas – that’s “completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart” – are the little tests you sometimes see when signing up to a website to help stop fraud. It may ask you to spot all the traffic lights in a picture, or type out some wobbly looking letters and numbers. If you get it wrong, it may ask you to start again, leading you to wonder if you really know what a traffic light looks like – or if you might be a robot after all. “You likely don’t enjoy being interrupted by these,” said Apple’s Tommy Pauly. “I certainly don’t. The reason these experiences exist is to prevent fraudulent activity. If you run a server, you don’t want it to be overwhelmed by fraud. Some attempts to create accounts or buy products come from legitimate users. But other attempts may be from attackers or bots.” The company worked with Fastly and Cloudflare, two companies that operate the infrastructure level of much of the public internet, to build the feature. It relies on the same sort of technology that underpins Apple’s efforts to replace passwords across the internet, and works by allowing your device to send an encrypted statement confirming it is being used by a human over to the requesting website. Although the service is tied in to Apple’s iCloud network, the requesting site will not receive any personal information about the user or their device. While Apple is the first to push such a technology to users themselves, the basic idea has been used by Google, which helped develop the standard and has built a similar system into Chrome. But Google’s version is so far focused on letting third parties build their own Captcha replacements, rather than ending the technology altogether. In fact, Google may even lose out from the shift: since the company bought a startup called reCaptcha in 2009, it has used the human input from the tests as part of its training data for large machine-learning projects, first asking people to help it transcribe scanned books and later using the responses to train its machine-vision systems about road features in order to perfect its self-driving car projects.","If you get it wrong, it may ask you to start again, leading you to wonder if you really know what a traffic light looks like – or if you might be a robot after all.

116,116,"Tether, the controversial “stablecoin” that underpins more than $60bn of the crypto economy, is launching a British version to capitalise on the UK government’s desire to make Britain a global cryptocurrency hub. Like its US dollar counterpart, of which $67bn (£55bn) is actively traded on cryptocurrency markets, the digital asset will be built on the Ethereum blockchain, but its value will be set at £1. “We believe that the United Kingdom is the next frontier for blockchain innovation and the wider implementation of cryptocurrency for financial markets. We hope to help lead this innovation by providing cryptocurrency users worldwide with access to a GBP-denominated stablecoin issued by the largest stablecoin issuer,” said Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s chief technology officer. “Tether is ready and willing to work with UK regulators to make this goal a reality and looks forward to the continued adoption of Tether stablecoins,” added Ardoino, who is also CTO of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, a dual role shared by the two companies’ chief executives, chief operating officers, chief financial officers and general counsels. The launch of the GBPT token comes at an inauspicious time for cryptocurrencies. The sector as a whole has contracted from almost $3tn of trading tokens to less than $1tn, and the flagship cryptocurrency, bitcoin, has fallen from a high of $69,000 to less than $20,000. Tether ‘slargest token, the USD tether, has fallen by more than $8bn in just over a week as holders race to cash out into safer assets, and the total value circulating has dropped by nearly $20bn since the peak. Despite the falls, Tether says its business has never been more stable, and points to the speed with which the billions were withdrawn as evidence of its firm foundations. In early June, the company put out a statement boasting: “Tether recently faced redemption requests for $10bn of USD₮ redemptions within a single week and was able to fulfil all requests in full with ease; $10bn of redemptions represented more than 12% of outstanding USD₮ tokens. No bank in the world could process the withdrawal of 12% of its outstanding liabilities within a week.” The company claims that every Tether is backed one to one by assets held in reserve, which is how it maintains its stability. It is a different claim from the one it made when it launched its business: that every Tether was backed by US dollars held in reserve. An investigation from the New York attorney general’s office concluded that claim was a “lie” and Tether was barred from operating in New York and fined $18m. Despite the crypto crash, the UK government says it continues to support the sector, and singled out stablecoins as an area needing regulatory encouragement. A Treasury spokesperson said: “We are firmly committed to putting the UK’s financial services sector at the forefront of cryptoasset technology and innovation. This includes creating the conditions for stablecoins – when used as a means of payment – to operate and grow safely, while mitigating potential financial stability risks. The forthcoming financial services and markets bill will set up the framework for regulating stablecoins in the UK.” The Financial Conduct Authority and Bank of England declined to comment.","Tether, the controversial “stablecoin” that underpins more than $60bn of the crypto economy, is launching a British version to capitalise on the UK government’s desire to make Britain a global cryptocurrency hub. “Tether is ready and willing to work with UK regulators to make this goal a reality and looks forward to the continued adoption of Tether stablecoins,” added Ardoino, who is also CTO of the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, a dual role shared by the two companies’ chief executives, chief operating officers, chief financial officers and general counsels.

117,117,"Changpeng Zhao does not like ambiguous words. Which is just as well: the crypto industry, in which he is a leading figure, is in turmoil and crying out for clarity. The 45-year-old founder and chief executive of Binance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, meets the Observer in an upmarket London hotel after one of the most tumultuous weeks in the short history of digital money. Binance was forced to suspend its bitcoin business on 13 June for a few hours. On the same day, a major crypto lender, Celsius, also paused withdrawals. Then a big crypto hedge fund admitted it was in trouble. Finally, last Saturday, in a symbolic moment, bitcoin fell below $20,000. The cornerstone of crypto has lost more than half its value this year, leaving both professional and amateur investors nursing steep losses. Often referred to by the nickname CZ (see-zee), Zhao is dressed in the classic tech-tycoon mix of formal dark suit with a company T-shirt and trainers. He says he is travelling from country to country at the moment, meeting with “different government officials, regulators”. Despite his softly spoken manner, he is on a mission to convince. The conversation gets hooked on semantics at times – perhaps a response to the level of scrutiny he and his business are under. Asked if he still considers the recent crypto market moves to be “normal”, as he described them this month, Zhao says: “Normal depends on how you look at it … everybody has a different definition of normal … fluctuations in price is normal.” There is a similar focus on meaning when Zhao is asked about money laundering – “the word is very different in different countries” – although he says Binance can “for sure” do a “good enough job that the regulators are happy”. Last June, the Financial Conduct Authority ordered Binance to stop all regulated activities in Britain, saying it was “not capable of being effectively supervised”. Zhao has not given up, however, and says he is seeking a licence to operate. Last week, Bloomberg ran an interview with him that raised the prospect of a deep regulatory winter for his business. He responded by tweeting to his 6.5 million followers: “I will stop doing interviews with news outlets that do clickbait titles.” He clearly has a deep interest in media. Binance has announced plans for a $200m (£160m) investment in Forbes, the business publisher, as well as investing $500m in Elon Musk’s $44bn bid for Twitter. Born in the coastal province of Jiangsu, north of Shanghai, Zhao followed his academic father to Canada when he was 12. After graduating from Montreal’s McGill University with a degree in computer science he worked on programming systems for the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Bloomberg. Zhao then moved to Shanghai in 2005, where he founded a high-frequency trading platform. It was there that he was drawn into a conversation about bitcoin during a poker game in 2013. Binance was founded four years later. *** CV Age 45 Family “I like to keep that private for security and privacy reasons.” Education McGill University, Canada.

The Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimates that his wealth – based on a 90% stake in Binance and his control of its related US exchange – has fallen by more than $75bn since January to $20.6bn, as the wider market has more than halved over the same period to about $900bn. Zhao laughs that off. “I actually have no idea how they come up with those numbers. You need to understand that net worth are just estimates,” he says. “When I look at my wallet, I don’t have that much. I don’t have anywhere close to any of those numbers.” If you are wondering how Zhao could find $20bn in his wallet anyway, he is referring to his crypto wallet – the encrypted account on a blockchain where digital money is stored. Although all blockchain activity is technically public, most large investors try to keep their wallets pseudonymous, and Zhao’s has not been publicly identified. Binance makes money by connecting buyers with sellers, for a fee. It provides an exchange for a range of currencies, from bitcoin to dogecoin and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The company also offers to store those assets in a crypto wallet, and there is a range of financial products, including derivatives. It has 120 million customers globally and processes $1tn worth of trades a month, with Italy and France among the countries it is allowed to operate in, although customers can access it through the unregulated, offshore binance.com platform. Last year, Zhao told the AP news agency that he only held bitcoin and his firm’s own crypto-asset, BNB. One issue puzzling regulators is the lack of clarity about Binance’s structure. The holding company is registered in the Cayman Islands but the company describes itself as having “decentralised” ownership, with its terms and conditions referring to an “ecosystem”. For instance, its US exchange is separate from the main binance.com platform, whose operating base is not disclosed. Some of the other questions over Binance are more serious. Reuters published a report in June that alleged it had served as a conduit for the laundering of at least $2.35bn in illicit funds from hacks, investment frauds and illegal drug sales. Zhao says he disputes the claims “very heavily”, adding the public record afforded by blockchains should have enabled Binance to trace the transactions. “We ask for a list of transactions, not just a list of names. They provided zero.” Reuters said: “We stand by our reporting on Binance, which has been consistent with the Trust Principles [its in-house guidelines] of accuracy and freedom from bias.” The conversation moves on to those who have had savings wiped out by the crypto rout. “We absolutely have sympathy for anyone who has lost money in trading in any market, including stock markets,” says Zhao. He says financial literacy is key, and mentions his company’s own Binance Academy. He concedes there could be more failures in the crypto market. But he is unambiguous that there will be survivors. “There may be other failures. But crypto will stay, bitcoin will stay, ethereum will stay, BNB will stay. That part is quite certain.”","The 45-year-old founder and chief executive of Binance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, meets the Observer in an upmarket London hotel after one of the most tumultuous weeks in the short history of digital money. Asked if he still considers the recent crypto market moves to be “normal”, as he described them this month, Zhao says: “Normal depends on how you look at it … everybody has a different definition of normal … fluctuations in price is normal.” There is a similar focus on meaning when Zhao is asked about money laundering – “the word is very different in different countries” – although he says Binance can “for sure” do a “good enough job that the regulators are happy”. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimates that his wealth – based on a 90% stake in Binance and his control of its related US exchange – has fallen by more than $75bn since January to $20.6bn, as the wider market has more than halved over the same period to about $900bn.

118,118,"An advocacy group for Australian Muslims has lodged a complaint against Twitter with the Queensland Human Rights Commission, accusing the site of failing to take action against accounts that incite hatred on the platform. The Australian Muslim Advocacy Network (Aman) argues that as a publisher Twitter is responsible for content posted by a far-right account that has been cited in the manifesto of the extremist who killed 77 people in Norway in 2011. The network says despite multiple requests, Twitter has refused to delete the account and replies to its posts that “vilify” Muslims. These include comments such as “Ramadan means killing infidels” and claims that the Qur’an should be referred to as the “terrorist handbook”. Comments cited in the complaint refer to the Qur’an as “this satanic memoir” and to Islam as “the most violent and sexually perverse cult”. The network has accused Twitter under Queensland’s Anti-Discrimination Act of inciting hatred as a publisher of third-party accounts, as well as discrimination for refusing to take action against hateful content. Its complaint also says Twitter has engaged in indirect discrimination by failing to apply Australian standards to content on its platform. The network says it engaged with Twitter between July 2020 to July 2021. Aman says it asked the platform to remove several accounts that were inciting hatred but Twitter refused to act, saying the accounts were assessed to be “consistent with their policies”. The complaint before the Commission contains 419 items, including 29 tweets it claims incited hatred and 390 comments and quotes on those tweets. Rita Jabri Markwell, a lawyer for the network, said: “We were engaging with Twitter for over a year with really shocking examples. Pictures of Muslim men with guns being shoved into their mouths and pictures of Muslims depicted as monkeys and cavemen chasing people with knives. “We want Twitter to take responsibility for their platform. It shouldn’t be left up to ordinary people to monitor their platform for them.” Twitter’s hateful conduct policy says users “may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity … sexual orientation ... gender … [or] religious affiliation”. It says the platform does “not allow accounts whose primary purpose is inciting harm towards others on the basis of these categories”. Australia’s high court found media companies could be liable for third-party comments on their social media posts in the landmark Dylan Voller case last year. In 2021, the advocacy network successfully sought orders to remove 141 pieces of content published by the former senator Fraser Anning from Facebook and Twitter. Twitter refused to take the content down until the court ruling. The network also has a race discrimination and section 18C complaint on foot through the Australian Human Rights Commission against Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram. “We only take these legal actions because it’s our only option at the moment. We would like to see the burden shifts from us to to a regulator, likely the eSafety Commissioner,” Jabri Markwell said. The network wants Twitter to immediately remove accounts that serially tweet material that incite hatred against Muslims, including those that propagate “great replacement” and “counter jihad” theories. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The group is seeking compensation from Twitter “for the work involved in preparing their complaint, and for the hardship and trauma their failure to act caused to Aman’s staff and volunteers”. “When that commentary is allowed online, it makes it normal and we see it being repeated in comment threads about the news,” Jabri Markwell said. “As a Muslim … it immediately makes you feel like you’re on the outer and deeply disrespected. “We are contributing, hardworking, caring members of this community and we deserve to be treated with respect.” Twitter did not respond to numerous requests for comment.","An advocacy group for Australian Muslims has lodged a complaint against Twitter with the Queensland Human Rights Commission, accusing the site of failing to take action against accounts that incite hatred on the platform.

119,119,"On Friday, the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 decision which held that access to an abortion was a constitutionally guaranteed right. In 13 states with “trigger laws”, abortion was immediately – or will imminently be – outlawed. Others may follow. As Americans grapple with the reality of the repeal, in one of just 11 countries around the world to have restricted access in the last three decades, the initial focus has been on how to continue to provide access to abortion – and how to guarantee the safety of women. In the moments after the decision was handed down, calls to delete period tracking apps went viral, with users concerned that the data they collect may end up incriminating women; some companies took public stands, committing themselves to defending their users. “At this fraught moment, we hear the anger and the anxiety coming from our US community,” period tracking app Clue said. “We remain committed to protecting your reproductive health data.” But the questions around personal data go far further than the narrow focus on reproductive health apps could suggest. From our story by Kari Paul: Abortion and civil rights advocates have warned that there are few federal regulations on what information is collected and retained by tech firms, making it easy for law enforcement officials to access incriminating data on location, internet searches and communication history. Such data has already been used to prosecute people for miscarriages and pregnancy termination in states with strict abortion laws, including one case in which a woman’s online search for abortion pills was brought against her in court. Digital rights advocacy group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has advised companies in the tech world to pre-emptively prepare for a future in which they are served with subpoenas and warrants seeking user data to prosecute abortion seekers and providers. It recommends companies allow pseudonymous or anonymous access, stop behavioural tracking, and retain as little data as possible. It also advocated for end-to-end encryption by default and refrain from collecting any location information. The ruling has also highlighted the general lack of privacy protections in US law. The connection is more than just tangential: the decision in Roe v Wade is based on the right to privacy, which the supreme court held to be provided by the 14th amendment to the US constitution. That right was first affirmed in an earlier decision, Griswold v Connecticut, which protected a married couple’s rights to contraception; supreme court justice Clarence Thomas stated, in his concurrence overturning Roe, that that decision should also be re-examined. In Clue’s commitment to protecting its users’ privacy, the company highlighted that, as a Berlin-based organisation, its users are protected by GDPR. “As a European company, Clue is obligated under the world’s strictest data privacy law, the European GDPR, to apply special protections to such health data,” the company said. “If we hold your data, our obligation under European law to protect your privately tracked data is the same. No US Court or other authority can override that, since we are not based in the US. Our user data cannot simply be subpoenaed from the US.” American privacy experts caution that “dragnet” style surveillance of women’s reproductive health, with authorities demanding companies hand over entire databases, is unlikely to occur. Legal pressure could be put on such companies to pro-actively report users, however, and in the meantime the focus should instead be on protecting individual women who have been targeted for investigation. From Kari’s article: Experts are also encouraging individuals seeking abortions to use heightened data security practices, including encrypted communications and disabling location tracking. The Roe decision has highlighted a longstanding privacy crisis affecting users of the most commonly used tech services, said Imran Ahmed, chief executive officer of advocacy group the Center for Countering Digital Hate. The response of major tech companies to the ruling has been complicated. As a first priority, many have focused inward, announcing policies to protect their own employees. Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft, for instance, have all confirmed they will cover travel expenses for employees who need to leave their home state to access “lawful medical services where access to care is limited in availability”, in the words of Microsoft’s policy. But major companies have been less forthcoming about their promises to their users. Facebook, Uber, Apple and Google all failed to respond to queries about how they would handle sensitive data and respond to law enforcement requests in the future. With Texas one of the 13 states with “trigger laws” on the books, the case has also raised questions about the state’s ability to tempt companies to relocate from Silicon Valley. Austin, a leftwing stronghold and the state capital, has been developing a burnishing reputation as a tech hub, and car company Tesla – owned by Elon Musk – moved its headquarters there late last year. SpaceX, Musk’s other company, has a launch facility on the Texas coast. Tesla is one of the companies promising to cover employees for “healthcare services that are unavailable in their home state”. Musk himself has been silent on the ruling, though his “pinned tweet” from 24 May is a screenshot of a Wall Street Journal chart showing the declining American birthrate.

120,120,"Amazon is launching a fleet of e-cargo bikes and a team of on-foot delivery staff to replace thousands of van deliveries on London’s roads. The online retailer is opening its first “micromobility” hub in Hackney, east London, which – along with an existing fleet of electric vehicles – will contribute to 5m deliveries a year across about a 10th of the capital’s ultra low emission zone postcode districts. The bikes will be operated by a variety of partner businesses, not directly by Amazon, it is understood. Amazon plans more such delivery hubs around the UK this year as part of its efforts to cut its carbon emissions. The company was named as the partner for a cargo bike and on-foot delivery hub in the City of London’s London Wall car park in 2020, but that project has yet to come to fruition. John Boumphrey, the UK country manager of Amazon, said: “Amazon is driving towards a global net-zero carbon future. One way we’re doing that is through the transformation of our transportation networks. Our new e-cargo bikes, walkers and growing electric vehicle delivery fleet will help us make more zero emission customer deliveries than ever before across London and the UK in the coming months.” Cllr Mete Coban, Hackney council cabinet member for environment and transport, welcomed the plan. “Tackling transport emissions is key if we’re to reach net zero. We’re really pleased to have worked with Amazon to support them to take traditional vans off the streets and replace them with e-cargo bikes. This will help to reduce emissions and improve air quality for people in Hackney and beyond,” Coban said. Amazon’s move comes as window cleaners, milk and beer deliverers, plumbers and DJs all get on their bikes as the result of UK government incentives, new infrastructure and promises to reduce the carbon footprint of businesses. About 2,000 cargo bikes were sold in the UK for commercial use in 2020, according to the Bicycle Association, and a similar number were sold for use by families and individuals. That number is expected to have soared last year. Specialist delivery services, such as Pedal Me and Velocious, have expanded rapidly during the pandemic with one service, Zedify, setting up 10 mini-hubs on brownfield sites outside cities to make thousands of zero emission deliveries into each city every day. Boumphrey said Amazon would also install more than 30,000 solar panels on its facilities in Manchester, Coalville, Haydock Green, Wakefield, Bristol and Milton Keynes by the end of this year. The company has confirmed 18 solar projects at its existing UK sites this year and plans to more than double the number of projects by 2024. These projects come alongside addition to a windfarm on Scotland’s Kintyre peninsula and a further four planned including at Kennoxhead in South Lanarkshire.","The online retailer is opening its first “micromobility” hub in Hackney, east London, which – along with an existing fleet of electric vehicles – will contribute to 5m deliveries a year across about a 10th of the capital’s ultra low emission zone postcode districts.

121,121,"The former Theranos executive Sunny Balwani has been convicted on all 12 fraud charges brought against him for his role at the now-defunct blood testing company. The decision closes the final chapter of Theranos’s legal saga, nearly eight years after serious concerns were raised about the startup’s blood testing technology. The conviction of Balwani, who at one point oversaw the Theranos lab and put millions of his own fortune into the company, also marks a more severe judgment than that of his former lover and business partner Elizabeth Holmes, who was convicted of only four of 11 of the same charges in January. Holmes was convicted of defrauding investors but was cleared on charges of defrauding patients, while Balwani was convicted on all charges – including those specific to patients. Jurors in San Jose, California, announced the decision on Thursday following a 13-week trial that chronicled Balwani’s role in the medical tech firm that promised to revolutionize the world of medicine. The jury, made up of five men and seven women, deliberated for 32 hours before returning a verdict around noon. The 57-year-old businessman had pleaded not guilty and now faces as many as 20 years in prison. Holmes is out on bail and will be sentenced on 26 September. Balwani will be sentenced on 15 November. Holmes and Balwani, former business and romantic partners, had vowed to upend the medical testing industry with a blood test that could scan for more than 200 potential health problems with just a few drops of blood, a promise that was later discovered to have little basis in reality. The company had risen to the top of Silicon Valley with Holmes at the helm, attracting big-name investors including the former secretaries of state George Schultz and Henry Kissinger. At its height, Theranos was valued at more than $9bn. Its downward spiral began when in 2015, Wall Street Journal reporting aided by company whistleblowers revealed in-house tests had serious inaccuracies and that the company was performing other tests using traditional blood drawing methodology and outside labs. Throughout his trial, federal prosecutors depicted Balwani as a willing accomplice to the fraud spearheaded by Holmes. Lawyers called on witnesses including investors and executives who said Balwani shared false financial projections about the viability of the company. “Mr Balwani is not a victim. He is the perpetrator of the fraud,” prosecutor Jeffrey Schenk said near the end of his three-and-a-half-hour closing arguments. Prosecutors also displayed texts from Balwani to Holmes in which he said: “I am responsible for everything at Theranos. All have been my decisions too.” Defense attorneys depicted Balwani as a loyal soldier who under the direction of Holmes tried to save the blood-testing company. Balwani, who met Holmes when she was 19 and he was 38, put $15m of his own funds into Theranos between 2009 and 2011, “because he believed in Holmes’s vision”, his lawyers said. He also acted as chief operating officer of the company from 2010 to 2016, when the company was broken up. In her own trial, Holmes accused Balwani of abuse – charges he strongly denied. The guilty verdicts for both Holmes and Balwani have been seen as an indictment of the tech industry, and the end of an era in which companies can ride unchecked hype backed by little substance to large amounts of funding. Prosecutors underscored throughout the trial the real-world impact of Theranos, including tests that inaccurately told patients they were experiencing miscarriages or cancer. “The story of Theranos is a tragedy,” Schenk said in closing arguments.","The conviction of Balwani, who at one point oversaw the Theranos lab and put millions of his own fortune into the company, also marks a more severe judgment than that of his former lover and business partner Elizabeth Holmes, who was convicted of only four of 11 of the same charges in January.

122,122,"Aspiring dancers are risking injury by copying advanced moves and taking part in viral challenges on TikTok, leading dance organisations have warned. The Royal Academy of Dance says young people should be careful when attempting to recreate moves by professional dancers, or taking part in challenges on social media. In an interview with The Stage, artistic director, Gerard Charles, says that while the platform can be a great inspiration for amateur dancers, supervision from a trained teacher is key to avoiding injury. “Watching dance on TikTok can provide great inspiration, but without an experienced and qualified teacher who understands physical development and age-appropriate movement, it is all too easy for copying what is seen on social media to lead to injuries,” he said. Louise Molton, the director of education at the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing, encouraged aspiring dancers to consider formal training. “Repetition of routines without targeted feedback does not support technical and artistic development and can lead to injury and poor practice,” she said. “Learning without a teacher, who can provide correction in the early stages of any physical activity, could be dangerous and could lead to permanent injury or damage later in life.” Last week the American actor Kyra Sedgwick was pictured with an ice pack on her wrist after attempting the “Footloose Drop”, a current TikTok dance trend. Her husband, Kevin Bacon, who starred in the film, shared the picture of Sedgwick, 56, on Instagram, with the caption: “The aftermath of nailing a TikTok dance #Footloose”, after the couple successfully pulled off the move. In 2020, a spate of TikTok users reportedly became injured after attempting a complicated set of moves to “WAP” by Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion during the first Covid lockdown. According to the New York Post, at least one aspiring dancer was taken to hospital after copying the viral dance which includes splits, twerking and a leaping high kick. TikTok has, however, also won praise for its inclusivity and for encouraging young people to discover new interests. Danielle Drayton, the creative director at Blue Fish Entertainments, said breaking moves down into short tutorials can be more engaging for social media users than a formal lesson. “With inspiring companies such as the Rockettes or the cast of Dance Moms breaking down a dance move in 15 to 30 seconds, at times dance can seem less tedious online than in a class,” she said. TikTok advises anyone starting a new fitness programme or exercise routine to seek advice or guidance from a qualified professional.","In an interview with The Stage, artistic director, Gerard Charles, says that while the platform can be a great inspiration for amateur dancers, supervision from a trained teacher is key to avoiding injury. “Learning without a teacher, who can provide correction in the early stages of any physical activity, could be dangerous and could lead to permanent injury or damage later in life.” Last week the American actor Kyra Sedgwick was pictured with an ice pack on her wrist after attempting the “Footloose Drop”, a current TikTok dance trend.

123,123,"Elon Musk withdrew his $44bn bid to buy Twitter on Friday after a months-long saga that rankled investors and shook the market, kicking off what may be a long legal battle with the company. The Twitter chair, Bret Taylor, said on Friday that the social media firm would sue in a Delaware court to enforce the deal. The deal included a “specific performance” clause, a provision that may force Musk to buy the company as long as he has financing in place. Musk in May said he had secured financing to complete the deal. Musk may also face a fine of $1bn to walk away, a penalty he is seeking to evade by accusing Twitter of a “breach of multiple provisions” of the agreement, according to a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission announcing the dissolution of the offer. “For nearly two months, Mr Musk has sought the data and information necessary to ‘make an independent assessment of the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on Twitter’s platform’,” Musk’s team stated in the letter. “Twitter has failed or refused to provide this information.” The data in question centers on the number of spam accounts on the app, which Twitter has claimed make up about 5% of more than 200m users but Musk believes is higher. Analysts have speculated that the bot issue is being purposely overstated by the executive. “What Musk and his team are doing is trying to come up with an excuse so that he doesn’t have to pay the penalty fees to walk away,” said Anat Beck, a professor and business law expert at Case Western Reserve University. In addition to the fine for the failed deal, Musk could face serious consequences from the SEC for his antics, which have had major impacts on the several public companies he manages as well as Twitter itself. Musk is an executive at the artificial intelligence firm Neuralink, the electric car company Tesla, the space travel company SpaceX, and the tunnel construction firm the Boring Company. He has in the past faced lawsuits from investors over his erratic behavior and its effects on the companies’ stocks. In May, Twitter investors filed a class action lawsuit against Musk for failing to disclose his growing investment in the company, costing them millions in value. That lawsuit is ongoing. He has also faced additional legal ramifications over his tweets after a 2018 post in which he claimed to be taking the company private, a move that knocked $14bn off of Tesla’s value. The market-moving 2018 tweet resulted in a $40m fine from the SEC, as well as an agreement that Musk would step down as chairman of the Tesla board. Fines against Musk, who with a $224bn net worth is now the richest man in the world, have had negligible impacts, said Beck, but the executive could face further action from the SEC – including being removed as CEO from one or more of the companies he helms. “The fine will be painful for Musk, but what would be more painful is if the SEC used its power to say ‘you are not fit to run the companies you are running and someone else should be appointed as CEO’,” Beck said. Musk’s waffling on the Twitter decision has led many to call for legislation that prevents such market chaos in the future, or enforcement from bodies outside the SEC. Meanwhile, Musk and Twitter could be battling in court for some time, and Musk will face additional class action lawsuits, Beck said. “Investors in any company that has been impacted by this can bring forth a lawsuit,” she said. “The question is: do we have fraud? Do we have a billionaire that is doing this purposely to impact the markets? That is legally what needs to be answered.”","Musk may also face a fine of $1bn to walk away, a penalty he is seeking to evade by accusing Twitter of a “breach of multiple provisions” of the agreement, according to a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission announcing the dissolution of the offer. In addition to the fine for the failed deal, Musk could face serious consequences from the SEC for his antics, which have had major impacts on the several public companies he manages as well as Twitter itself. Musk is an executive at the artificial intelligence firm Neuralink, the electric car company Tesla, the space travel company SpaceX, and the tunnel construction firm the Boring Company. Fines against Musk, who with a $224bn net worth is now the richest man in the world, have had negligible impacts, said Beck, but the executive could face further action from the SEC – including being removed as CEO from one or more of the companies he helms. ","That lawsuit is ongoing.

124,124,"A TikTok “frog army” has racked up millions of likes – but the potential consequences of the bizarre stunt are no joke, experts say. In February of this year, a young TikTok user who claims to be based in the UK started building out a “frog army” after noticing “some type of eggs in a shallow pond near his home”. In recent videos, he claimed to have gathered more than 1.4m eggs that have hatched into tadpoles in a backyard pool he built. “I wanted to create the largest frog army in history,” he said in one video. “Next year I will create a giant pond for 10 million frogs.” Also this spring, another TikTok user claimed to have released 100 million ladybugs in Central Park in New York City. In later posts, he claimed he had been served a lawsuit in response and had fled the US. Racking up hundreds of millions of views as commenters egged them on, both users have continued to escalate their stunts, promising more releases of larger numbers of animals. They’ve even hinted at meeting up. While the Guardian could not independently confirm the veracity of both users’ accounts – neither responded to multiple requests for comments and there has been speculation the videos may be a hoax – the massive popularity of the videos has scientists concerned. The “frog army” leader” now has more than 2 million followers and over 20m cumulative likes across his page. The “lady bug raid” conductor has more than 42m views on his videos. “It makes me cringe,” said Tierra Curry, a conservation biologist at the Center for Biological Diversity. Relocating species like frogs and butterflies can have grave impacts, Curry said. “Instead of helping, [These TikTok users] are actually hurting the animals they’re releasing and all the animals in the environment that they’re releasing them into – it’s creating a vector for disease and invasive species,” she said. Scientists say if true, the frog release is alarming given that human relocation of frogs is a top threat to the species. One fungus introduced by humans redistributing amphibians has caused a “mass extinction” event, wiping out more than 90 species of frogs. “It’s the law of unintended consequences,” said Chris Nagano, who worked 27 years as an endangered species biologist at the US Fish and Wildlife Service. “I have no doubt this person may have thought he was doing a good thing, but he may actually be driving these populations to extinction.” Experts are concerned that the way TikTok operates is exacerbating the problem. TikTok differs from platforms like Instagram and Twitter in that its feed is made up largely of people a user does not follow, allowing content from across the web to be surfaced by the algorithms. Because the way its feed works remains relatively unknown, users are more likely to post increasingly “unexpected” content to boost their views, said Ioana Literat, an associate professor at the teachers college of Columbia University. “Because it is such a black box, a lot of users are just throwing things at the wall to see what sticks,” she said. “More so than well-established platforms, the ethos of the TikTok really amplifies the unusual and creative.” When videos do go viral, the platforms’ 1 billion monthly active user base guarantees an extremely wide reach. The app’s popularity has created an evolving business model in which creators are shifting from “persona-based fame” to “content-based” fame, said Literat. “People no longer need to build a following over time, they just need to do one wacky or unexpected thing that goes viral and the followers will come later,” she said. In both the frog and ladybug cases, the users were in conversation with, and encouraged by, their followers. Frog army followers commented on the user’s videos asking how they can collect their own eggs. And the user behind the ladybug release claimed to have explicitly launched his stunt in exchange for engagement saying, “if this video gets 30 likes I will buy 100 million lady bugs and do a lady bug invasion in NYC.” “They are doing this to get likes or shares,” said Curry, the conservation biologist. “It’s a popularity stunt that can have extremely negative consequences.” She noted such releases could also be illegal. Laws vary by country and state, Curry said, but she encouraged people to call their state wildlife agency if they see such activity on TikTok. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","In February of this year, a young TikTok user who claims to be based in the UK started building out a “frog army” after noticing “some type of eggs in a shallow pond near his home”.

125,125,"Elon Musk just couldn’t help himself on Monday morning. Having announced the termination of his $44bn (£37bn) takeover of Twitter, he took to the platform he no longer wants to buy and mocked its likely legal response. Musk’s tweet to his 100 million followers stated: “They want to force me to buy Twitter in court.” Twitter does indeed have grounds to seek an order requiring Musk to buy the business, despite him pulling out in a dispute over the number of spam or bot accounts on the platform. But, as has often been the case with the deal itself, the world’s richest man doesn’t appear to take the threat seriously. “Now they have to disclose bot info in court,” says one caption in the tweet, illustrated by a series of photos of Musk laughing uproariously. It was followed by a picture of the vintage action star Chuck Norris at a chessboard, with Musk tweeting under it: “Chuckmate.” Despite being surrounded by the best advisers money can buy, Musk has had an erratic relationship with the legal minutiae of his now abandoned $44bn Twitter takeover. On the one hand, his legal team has filed tightly argued disclosures against the deal, citing various clauses in the agreement. On the other, he posts poo emojis at the people he is negotiating with. Indeed, the scatological cartoon directed at Twitter’s CEO, Parag Agrawal, probably broke a merger agreement that Musk has now reneged on. More than two months ago, Musk signed an agreement to buy the social media platform that contained a clause where he pledged not to “disparage” the company or its employees. A day later Musk was engaging with criticism of company staff on the platform, including of Twitter’s legal head, Vijaya Gadde. Twitter’s former CEO, Dick Costolo, accused Musk of bullying Gadde. It was the first sign that Musk was not taking the deal seriously, or at least was unwilling to curb his behaviour in line with the deal agreement. It probably didn’t surprise Twitter, given the clause inserted in the deal and Musk’s previous history on Twitter. In 2018, Musk reached a settlement with the US financial watchdog over a tweet in which he said he had “funding secured” for a proposal to take Tesla off the stock market. According to one legal expert, Musk’s behaviour breached the agreement but Twitter’s desire to do the deal overrode their concerns. “Yes some of his tweets breached the agreement but there’s no real remedy here because it doesn’t matter how much Musk disparages Twitter. They want to do this deal,” said Brian Quinn, an associate professor at Boston College law school. In a letter disclosed on Monday, Twitter said Musk’s termination of the agreement was “invalid and wrongful”. It cited the disparagement clause as one of the areas where Musk had violated the deal. Twitter has said it will go to court in Delaware, the US state that has jurisdiction over the deal, in order to “enforce the merger agreement”. Its options include seeking a $1bn break fee from Musk or asking a judge for “specific performance”, which means requiring Musk to push ahead with the agreed transaction at $54.20 a share. Musk certainly presumes that Twitter will choose the latter. Musk appeared to be serious about buying the business when news of his offer broke on 14 April, even if the $54.20 price hinted at a weed joke, given “420” is slang for marijuana. The billionaire said he wanted to release the platform’s “extraordinary potential” to boost free speech and democracy across the world. He told a TED conference: “Having a public platform that is massively trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilisation.” Even as it became clear that Musk was heading for the exit, he met Twitter staff in a Q&amp;A where he said he wanted the platform to contribute to a “better, long-lasting civilisation”. He was also interested enough in the business to assemble a financing package that included $13bn from banks and a commitment of more than $30bn from his own pocket, although that included contributions from the Binance cryptocurrency trading platform and the tech tycoon Larry Ellison. Nonetheless, his hot-cold behaviour has led some observers to wonder how serious he was about buying the company. If he meant to buy the company at the beginning, a recent rout in tech shares helped change his mind, says Drew Pascarella, a senior lecturer on finance at Cornell University. “Elon is a bold and controversial public figure. Twitter is a platinum social media platform that Elon himself has used, controversially, for years. Acquisition of the asset, and the ability to control it, is the ultimate boss move,” Drew says. “I do think Elon was serious, and the banks thought so, too. Given what’s happened to equity values since the deal was inked, he risked looking very stupid by paying what is now an outlandish price.” Twitter shares, which fell 11.3% in New York on Monday to $32.65, have declined by about 23% so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index gives an idea of the wider market, having fallen 25% so far this year. Musk’s lawyers are among the few legal voices who think he has a chance in Delaware. His argument centres on the veracity of Twitter’s statement in its quarterly filings that spam accounts represent less than 5% of its active daily user base, which is 229 million people currently. Twitter has stated this consistently since 2014 and has supplied Musk with public tweet data in an attempt to convince him that its estimate is robust. Musk’s argument for tearing up the deal is threefold: that Twitter had breached the agreement by failing to provide enough information on spam accounts; that Twitter has misrepresented the number of spam accounts in its disclosures to the US financial watchdog; and that the company breached the agreement by failing to consult with Musk when firing senior employees recently. Quinn, and others, think Musk won’t succeed. “Does Musk have strong legal arguments? In short, no,” Quinn says. Lawyers who are unsympathetic to Musk’s case say his information requests were not reasonable, that it is highly unlikely he will be able to prove the spam estimate is false, and that letting go of senior execs was part of the day-to-day business of running the company. However, some legal and corporate experts also believe both sides will reach a settlement in order to avoid a situation where Musk is forced to buy a company he does not want, amid a legal battle that does further damage to the morale and share price of the company. Whatever happens next, anyone selling a business to Musk in the future is likely to tread warily, according to Anat Alon-Beck, a professor and business law expert at Case Western Reserve University. “I definitely think that his behaviour is going to make it very difficult to buy other companies,” she said. However, Pascarella said companies would still take notice when an entrepreneur with a $220bn fortunes comes calling. “No board should ignore overtures from the richest person in the world just because of his erratic behaviour,” he said, although businesses would need to “negotiate for clear and robust deal protections”. Twitter is about to find out how robust its protections are. In the meantime, Musk will no doubt keep tweeting on a platform he’d now rather use than own.","Musk’s tweet to his 100 million followers stated: “They want to force me to buy Twitter in court.” Twitter does indeed have grounds to seek an order requiring Musk to buy the business, despite him pulling out in a dispute over the number of spam or bot accounts on the platform.

127,127,"Garmin’s latest running watch has been upgraded in almost every way, bringing multisport tracking, more advanced GPS and a bunch of high-end features down to a more affordable price with the Forerunner 255. The longstanding series is available in two sizes for the first time with the 255 – a small 41mm-wide case and a larger 46mm model, which means it should fit comfortably on a wider range of runners’ wrists. But it has very big shoes to fill, replacing the well-regarded Forerunner 245 from 2019. Both sizes of watch have the same RRP. It is £300 ($350/A$629) for the standard model or £350 ($400/A$699) for a version capable of storing and playing music to Bluetooth headphones from Spotify and others without the need for a phone. The new watch has a sleeker design, more like 2020’s Forerunner 745 than the Forerunner 245. The sharper colour transflective LCD display is super clear in daylight with a backlight for night-time use but it doesn’t have a touchscreen, instead relying on five buttons for navigating the interface, which work well for exercise, even in adverse weather. The watch is snappier than its predecessor, too, making syncing and switching between data screens, activities and watch faces much faster. The watch is thin enough to fit under shirt cuffs while being light and very comfortable to wear all day and night for weeks without charge. Specifications Screen: 1.1 or 1.3in transflective MIP LCD Case size: 41 or 46mm Case thickness: 12.4 or 12.9mm Band size: standard 18 or 22mm quick release Weight: 39 or 49g Storage: 4GB Water resistance: 50 metres (5ATM) Sensors: GNSS (Multiband GPS, Glonass, Galileo, BeiDuo, QZSS), compass, thermometer, heart rate, pulse Ox Connectivity: Bluetooth, ANT+, wifi Longer battery life The 255 can be used independently of a phone but works best paired with an Android or iPhone via Bluetooth, which enables the syncing of your data to Garmin Connect and various smartwatch features such as call or message notifications. Alternatively, you can sync via USB cable to a PC or Mac or via wifi straight to the cloud on music-supporting models. The battery life is great. The 46mm version lasts about 14 days as a smartwatch with notifications, general heath tracking, including sleep, and more than three hours of activity tracking. That’s double the life of the Forerunner 245. The watch will last a good 16 hours of running with the most accurate location tracking mode active or up to seven hours while also listening to music. Switch to the more efficient GPS-only mode and it will last up to 30 hours of tracking. The smaller version lasts slightly less but both models can handle a marathon or even two depending on how fast you are. The new watch supports Garmin Pay, which is useful if you need to buy a drink or unexpectedly get the bus home while on a run, but few mainstream banks are supported in the UK. Sustainability The Forerunner 255 is generally repairable. The battery is rated to last at least a few years of frequent charge cycles while maintaining at least 80% capacity. The watch does not contain any recycled materials. Garmin guarantees at least two years of security updates from release but typically supports its devices far longer. It offers trade-in schemes for some lines and complies with WEEE and other local electronics recycling laws. Running and multisport The 255 builds on the excellent sport tracking capability of its predecessor, adding lots of new features and capabilities inherited from Garmin’s more expensive models. It has the firm’s new 4th-gen heart rate sensor, a barometer and compass, and the next-generation “multiband GPS”. This increases tracking accuracy and reliability around tall buildings or vegetation by locking on to newer frequencies from GPS satellites. It has plenty of useful features without being overloaded with gimmicks. The watch consistently gets a GPS lock within seconds – much faster than its predecessor – and produces more accurate live pace estimations when running. It records practically every metric you can think of allowing you to track or train by a wide variety of different methods including heart rate zones and power, although you’ll need a compatible foot pod or chest strap for running power (sold separately for a range of prices). It has the stamina feature introduced with the high-end Fenix 7, too, which is a useful live estimate of how much energy your body has left during a run. The other big upgrade is multisport tracking, such as for triathlons, a feature previously reserved for Garmin’s top models. It will track more than 30 different activities, including a collection of workouts across strength and cardio, multiple forms of cycling and swimming, and can combine them into one seamless event. Garmin has also beefed up its automated coaching system – free – which can now create a fully structured and adaptive training plan for races, including the buildup and tapering to help you perform your best on the day. It is currently designed for running, not cycling or multisport, but it is very impressive – few companies offer this level of personalised training plan, let alone one that adapts in real time to your progress. Health monitoring The 255 has a solid set of general health-tracking features, too. Automatic sleep tracking feeds into Garmin’s excellent body battery, which makes it easy to understand the impact of sleep, activity and rest on your day. It has stress tracking, all day heartbeat monitoring , the standard calories, steps, stairs and sedentary alerts, blood oxygen tracking and other metrics. Plus Vo2 Max fitness measurement, a standard cardiac measurement, and a tool estimating your recovery time after exercise. Overnight heart rate variability is a new metric, which takes three weeks to calibrate to your baseline and can then can be used to highlight over training, stress, illness and other factors. Price The Garmin Forerunner 255 comes in two sizes (41mm or 46mm) and costs £299.99 ($349.99/A$629) or £349.99 ($399.99/A$699) with offline music playback. For comparison, the Forerunner 55 costs £149.99, the Instinct 2 costs £299.99, the Forerunner 955 costs £479.99, the Fenix 7 costs £599.99. The Coros Pace 2 costs £180 and the Polar Vantage V2 costs £343.20. Verdict The new Forerunner 255 takes everything that was good about its excellent predecessor and turns it up to 11. The faster interface, longer 14-day battery life and option of different sizes for a better fit are very welcome. It is thin, light and comfortable to wear. It ticks almost every box for general health tracking, handles basic smartwatch functions and the top model supports offline music from Spotify and others. Garmin’s Connect app is the best in the business and provides easy syncing to Strava and other popular services. And the watch tracks almost every metric you can think of making it easy to see what is important for your training plan. The next-gen GPS upgrade and addition of true multisport tracking for triathlons and other events brings useful high-end features to a more palatable price. The new automatic race coach looks like it will be extremely useful tool, too. The only thing missing is onboard maps for route guidance if you get lost, which is still the reserve of more expensive models. The Forerunner 255 isn’t the cheapest on the market but it is the best. If you don’t need offline maps and routing, this running and multisport Garmin should be at the top of your list. Pros: slim, light, real buttons, clear screen, choice of sizes, multiband GPS, accurate heart rate, extensive stats, multisport, comprehensive health tracking, highly customisable, long battery life, optional offline music, basic smartwatch features. Cons: expensive, no touchscreen, screen fairly basic compared with smartwatches, no offline maps.

128,128,"Twitter sued Elon Musk on Tuesday to force him to complete his $44bn takeover of the social media giant after he announced on Friday he would withdraw his bid. “Musk’s exit strategy is a model of hypocrisy,” the lawsuit said, accusing the billionaire of making “bad faith” arguments against Twitter and carrying out “public and misleading attacks” on the company. The suit has kicked off what could be a long legal saga regarding the failed merger. The Tesla CEO and richest man on Earth had reached a deal to buy Twitter on 25 April, offering to purchase all of the company’s shares for $54.20 each, but he began to back out over allegations of “spam” accounts on the platform. “Musk entered into a binding merger agreement with Twitter, promising to use his best efforts to get the deal done,” according to the lawsuit. “Now, less than three months later, Musk refuses to honor his obligations to Twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests.” Because the deal included a provision called a “specific performance clause”, the court could force Musk to buy the company as long as he has financing in place, which he claimed to have secured in May. Musk could be ordered to pay $1bn for walking away, a penalty he indicated in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission he is seeking to evade. The SEC could levy additional penalties against Musk, including removing him from leadership of one or more of the several companies he leads, including Neuralink, Tesla, and SpaceX. The complaint details how Musk offered to buy Twitter at a relatively high price and backed out after a market slump led to a downturn in tech stocks. In order to successfully escape the deal without penalty, Musk would have to prove “material adverse effect” or breach of contract. “Musk had to try to conjure one of those,” the lawsuit states. To do so, Musk began to focus on the “spam bot” issue, the suit alleges. Twitter claimed spam accounts made up less than 5% of more than 200 million users but Musk insisted that the number was higher and accused Twitter of withholding information on the problem. Twitter revealed this month that it was suspending more than 1m spam accounts a day. Carl Tobias, a scholar at the University of Richmond School of Law, said the litigation could consume several months or longer, making a settlement likely. “The litigants will realize that it could be protracted, expensive and unproductive,” he said. “A protracted legal battle could be very expensive and time consuming, could distract both sides from moving on to more productive efforts to improve their current businesses and might reveal numerous embarrassing aspects of their business practices that could have detrimental effects on their reputations.” Musk declared his takeover bid on 14 April, and Twitter’s board agreed after Musk confirmed a funding package for the deal that included $21bn of his own money. With the deal, Musk stood to take control of a social media network with more than 200 million users. An avid but critical user of the platform, he had vowed to push through various reforms, including relaxing its content restrictions, ridding the platform of fake and automated accounts and shifting away from its advertising-based revenue model. Musk announced on 13 May that the deal was “on hold” while he awaited details supporting Twitter’s assertion on spam or fake accounts. He asserted the figure was 20% and said Twitter would need to show proof of the lower number for the purchase to go through. Twitter denies this in the strongly worded complaint, saying Musk continued to tweet, falsely, that Twitter had “failed to cooperate” in providing the information “apparently in the belief that repeating a falsehood enough can make it true”. The lawsuit details a number of tweets Musk sent “disparaging” the company, including a tweet directed at the Twitter CEO, Parag Agrawal, that contains a poop emoji and a number of memes. “For Musk, it would seem, Twitter, the interests of its stockholders, the transaction Musk agreed to, and the court process to enforce it all constitute an elaborate joke,” the complaint said. Musk seemed to respond to the lawsuit on Tuesday afternoon, tweeting: “Oh the irony lol.” Dan Milmo contributed to this story.","The Tesla CEO and richest man on Earth had reached a deal to buy Twitter on 25 April, offering to purchase all of the company’s shares for $54.20 each, but he began to back out over allegations of “spam” accounts on the platform. “Now, less than three months later, Musk refuses to honor his obligations to Twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests.” Because the deal included a provision called a “specific performance clause”, the court could force Musk to buy the company as long as he has financing in place, which he claimed to have secured in May. “A protracted legal battle could be very expensive and time consuming, could distract both sides from moving on to more productive efforts to improve their current businesses and might reveal numerous embarrassing aspects of their business practices that could have detrimental effects on their reputations.” Musk declared his takeover bid on 14 April, and Twitter’s board agreed after Musk confirmed a funding package for the deal that included $21bn of his own money. “For Musk, it would seem, Twitter, the interests of its stockholders, the transaction Musk agreed to, and the court process to enforce it all constitute an elaborate joke,” the complaint said.

An avid but critical user of the platform, he had vowed to push through various reforms, including relaxing its content restrictions, ridding the platform of fake and automated accounts and shifting away from its advertising-based revenue model. He asserted the figure was 20% and said Twitter would need to show proof of the lower number for the purchase to go through. “For Musk, it would seem, Twitter, the interests of its stockholders, the transaction Musk agreed to, and the court process to enforce it all constitute an elaborate joke,” the complaint said.

129,129,"A massive leak of confidential internal documents about Uber has cast new light on the strategies the cab-hailing company took to reach the top of its game. Goodbye “fake it till you make it”, hello “break it till you make it” – the rules, the law, and anything else that stands in your way. From our lead story: A leaked trove of confidential files has revealed the inside story of how the tech giant Uber flouted laws, duped police, exploited violence against drivers and secretly lobbied governments during its aggressive global expansion. The cache of files, which span 2013 to 2017, includes more than 83,000 emails, iMessages and WhatsApp messages, including often frank and unvarnished communications between Kalanick and his top team of executives. There is an awful lot here. There’s political wheeling and dealing, of course: Peter Mandelson helped Uber reach the Russian elite; Emmanuel Macron, then-economy minister, helped with the French. The former EU digital chief helped with the Dutch. Documents also suggest that George Osborne, meanwhile, “was a private supporter of the US company’s efforts to grow its business in the UK, just as the company simultaneously positioned itself to avoid future UK taxes.” While it was buddying up with politicians, the company was also building infrastructure to avoid the legal ramifications of its launches – which often came several years before the company would eventually be permitted to operate. A “kill switch”, built into its systems, let the company lock out local offices from its corporate network, preventing secrets being seized in police raids. And there’s also the fallout of its aggressive tactics. As protests against Uber raged around the world, the company’s own drivers were put in harms’ way: one report, during aggressive protests in western Europe, put the number of injured drivers at 18 in a day, with “three relatively serious cases involving taxi violence including one badly damaged car and two beaten-up drivers”. The response of co-founder and then-chief executive, Travis Kalanick, is “startlingly frank”, write the Guardian’s Felicity Lawrence and Jon Henley, and focused on the company’s battle with the French government: “‘If we have 50,000 riders they won’t and can’t do anything,’ he wrote. ‘I think it’s worth it. Violence guarantee[s] success. And these guys must be resisted, no? Agreed that right place and time must be thought out.’” Kalanick’s spokesperson “questioned the authenticity of some documents”, the reporters say, and that Kalanick “never suggested that Uber should take advantage of violence at the expense of driver safety” and any suggestion that he was involved in such activity would be completely false. Uber’s response has been to shift as much of the blame as possible on to Kalanick, who left the company under a cloud in 2017. “Five years ago, those mistakes culminated in one of the most infamous reckonings in the history of corporate America. That reckoning led to an enormous amount of public scrutiny, a number of high-profile lawsuits, multiple government investigations, and the termination of several senior executives,” the company said in a statement. “It’s also exactly why Uber hired a new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, who was tasked with transforming every aspect of how Uber operates.” To call the 2017 removal of Kalanick a reckoning serves to obscure the fact that Uber has never really had to look head-on at the tactics that earned it its place in the world. As tech analyst Benedict Evans put it: “Uber’s public, avowed strategy was to launch where the service was [more or less] illegal and bully politicians into approving it, rather than lobbying first, on the theory that lobbying wold [sic] fail unless you’d already shown people the service.” ‘Burning the burn’ The fall of Theranos prompted hand-wringing about the tech industry’s tendency to fake it til you make it. Where is the line between making bold promises and misleading investors? The legal saga that followed the collapse of that biotech company has revealed that the answer is, at least, “somewhere before ‘running labs filled with fake machines that don’t work’”. But if Theranos had actually invented the machines it said it was working on, then the early years would have been written off as mere stumbles, not as fraud. But the fall of the old Uber did little to halt the rise of the company, and didn’t prompt the same questioning about whether “break it till you make it” was itself a questionable approach. Just like Theranos, the company isn’t alone in taking that approach. If the rules stop your company from growing, complying with them is only one option: another option is break them, then grow so fast that when the punishment does come, it’s trivial compared to the advantage you gained. Uber’s defence was always that, even if it was breaking the rules, the rules were wrong. Taxi legislation was built for a different age, the company would argue in cities around the world, and needed to be rewritten to allow for nimble firms like itself. But Kalanick’s insight was that the argument was much more likely to succeed if the nimble firm was already popular and widely used, rather than a simple paper-lobbying procedure. And so the tactic was born: enter a market, grow rapidly, then fight to retroactively legalise your business. There were more conventional aggressive business practices alongside: in October 2014, for example, the business was subsidising driver wages in Berlin by almost five times as much as customers were paying. “Uber burned through cash to ‘buy revenue’, in the phrase of the presentation. At the same meeting a senior manager gave a talk about ‘burning the burn’ – that is, cutting subsidies.” Buying revenue wasn’t just about securing repeat customers who would stick with the company even as price slowly rose; it was also about buying passionate users who would write to local politicians to campaign for continued access to their cheap taxis, even while the company was making plans to remove the subsidy. Uber’s easy ride as a company is now over, and the years when it heavily subsidised riders have left a permanent mark on cities around the world. But even if its explosive growth peters out, and it survives as just a normal taxi app, it’s hard not to think that the example it sets for future entrepreneurs is a bad one. Break it till you make it, and you too might be cast out in a “reckoning” that still leaves you dynastically wealthy. Not much of a downside, is it? Elon continues So Elon Musk is now trying to pull out of buying Twitter. Maybe I was right when I said I was wrong, and he actually was bullshitting all along. “I am making a firm offer to take this company private” isn’t a very good joke for a typical CEO of a public company – it’s probably illegal, for one thing – but Elon Musk isn’t a typical executive. He’s already made the joke once before – why not make it again! The pretext for pulling out of the deal is so flimsy as to be barely worth paying hundreds of lawyers thousands of dollars an hour to get down on paper. Musk, who said he was buying Twitter to tackle the spam bots, now says he is pulling out of buying Twitter because the site has too many spam bots. Pull the other one. A more pressing question is whether he changed his mind for boring reasons: Twitter is worth less than it was; Tesla is worth less than it was; selling Tesla stock to buy Twitter at $54.20 is now an extraordinarily bad trade for Musk when once it was just a silly one – or for more interesting ones: has three months of being subject to endless discussions of moderation policy and political disputes-by-proxy made him realise that it wouldn’t be very fun to become the dude everyone is shouting at? Either way, the immediate question is whether or not Twitter can force him to close the deal, or merely summon up a fine in court. On paper, they have a good shout at the former, experts agree, since Musk doesn’t have a leg to stand on. But the Delaware Chancery court, where the case will be heard, doesn’t tend to love mandating “specific performance” – that’s forcing the deal through – and may be happy to settle for a hefty breakup fee, which would leave Twitter in a significantly worse position than if Musk had instead just downloaded some new video games when he got bored.

Three new shades of heart have been introduced – light blue, pink, and grey – as well as a smattering of animals, including a donkey and goose, vegetables in the form of peas and ginger, and cultural artefacts like maracas and a wooden flute. Two new icons have also been introduced: a pink Khanda to represent Sikhism alongside the other major world religions, and a blue wifi logo. The Unicode Consortium, an industry body that handles text rendering standards, is responsible for approving new emoji designs before individual smartphone manufacturers choose how to render them. For eight years, online resource Emojipedia has provided “sample images”, illustrating the new emoji in the style of Apple’s iOS emoji set, to help visualise how the designs will appear in next year’s updates. “Additionally, as this is only a draft emoji list, each emoji is subject to change prior to final approval in September 2022,” said Keith Broni, Emojipedia’s editor-in-chief. “However, it is worth noting the majority of draft emoji candidates have ended up included on the final list over the last number of years.” The pink heart is a particularly desired new emoji, Broni added, and has been one of the most popular emoji requests since the company began tracking them in 2016. But other than that, it’s slim pickings for emoji fans: the Emoji 15.0 update is the smallest ever, with just 31 new symbols being introduced. Last year, in Emoji 14.0, more than 100 were introduced. And for the first time, there’s not a single new “person-style” emoji among the new additions. The draft list is set to be finalised in September, at which point device manufacturers will be able to begin their own implementation. For iOS, that typically comes in January of each year, while Android handsets vary depending on the manufacturer.","A shaking head, pair of high-fiving hands and an afro comb are all set to head to smartphones over the next year as the draft list for Emoji 15.0 is revealed.

131,131,"Twitter experienced one of the site’s longest outages for years, with the social network completely unavailable to users around the globe on web and mobile for almost an hour. According to Downdetector.co.uk, which tracks site outages, the service became unavailable at 12:55pm UK time, and stayed off for 45 minutes. The site appears to have failed globally, with outages reported in the UK, US and Europe. The outage was the longest and most severe in years. Although Twitter was notorious for collapsing under heavy load in its early days, with older users fondly recalling the “fail whale” error message that appeared when the service was over capacity, it has not had a multi-hour outage since 2016, when it was unaccessible for two and a half hours. Since then, the site’s importance to global politics and culture has grown, and a long-lasting outage could even have had a material effect on the Conservative party’s leadership election, where runners and riders have been trading barbs since Boris Johnson announced his resignation last week. Unlike other major recent outages, the problem was limited to Twitter itself, and no major infrastructural layer of the internet seems to have been affected. Last year, an outage at “content distribution network” Fastly took down a broad swathe of the internet, including the Guardian, for almost an hour. That was triggered, Fastly said, by a single user updating their settings, triggering a cascading error that ultimately shutdown 85% of the sites that rely on its infrastructure to stay online. Twitter declined to comment on the outage, but pointed the Guardian to a tweet which reads: “Some of you are having issues accessing Twitter and we’re working to get it back up and running for everyone. Thanks for sticking with us.” On the site’s own status dashboard, the social network and all related services were wrongly marked as “operational” throughout the outage.","Twitter experienced one of the site’s longest outages for years, with the social network completely unavailable to users around the globe on web and mobile for almost an hour.

132,132,"Outside Amazon’s first in-person clothing store in California, Diemmi Le, 22, summed up her experience: “You don’t have to talk to anybody.” For years, Amazon tried – and ultimately failed – to translate its online book business into successful brick and mortar bookstores. Dozens of stores were shuttered this spring. Now, the online shopping giant is trying again, this time attempting to reinvent the mall clothing store. During the pandemic, Amazon pushed past Walmart to become the number one clothing retailer in the US, analysts from Wells Fargo concluded last year. The company is billing its new store as an ambitious fusion of its online shopping algorithm with an in-person shopping experience. The first Amazon Style store, which opened in Glendale, California, a suburb of Los Angeles, in May, allows customers to use a smartphone app to send clothes directly to their fitting rooms, rather than carrying them around, and offers additional clothing recommendations from the company’s algorithms. Clad in company lanyards, employees at the front of the store greet customers and offer help navigating the smartphone app and the store’s free WiFi and phone chargers. And there are plenty of other Amazon employees at work behind the scenes, swiftly delivering new outfit picks to the “magic closet” in each dressing room. But the store is designed to make many of its staff invisible: customers can use a dressing room touchscreen to summon a pair of pants in a different size, or a shirt in a different color, without having to see or speak to another human being. “It’s something new, something you’ve never seen before. It’s an experience, rather than just a regular store,” said Marshall Sanders, 28. ‘Hi-tech’, but limited In person, Amazon Style feels a bit like what someone in the 1990s might have imagined “hi-tech” shopping would look like in 2020. The store features a mix of known and even high-end brands, such as Levi’s, Vince and Theory, with the more obscure brands and cheap in-house clothing lines that Amazon customers are used to finding on the website. There are racks of $200 or $300 blouses in a “premium” section, but more racks of cheaply made T-shirts in trendy prints and sack-like floral dresses. Scan a summery floral Rebecca Taylor dress, which was offered for the discounted price of $276.50, and under “related items”, Amazon’s shopping app might recommend a floral dress in a similar color for $41.25. Several customers shopping at the Glendale store said the retail store’s selection was limited, and didn’t live up to the experience of shopping on Amazon’s online marketplace. Dana Roo and Diana Guerrero, both 25, had come from the west side of Los Angeles and San Diego specifically to check out the new Amazon store, but were disappointed by the lack of bargains they enjoy online. For them, Amazon was a place to find good “dupes” of higher-end clothes, like Ugg’s fuzzy lounge sets, Roo said. The brick-and-mortar store was offering only original sets. The store’s clothing options are organized thematically, in sections with names such as “rustic grace”, “feminine strength”, “Y2k”, and, more pragmatically, “night out tops under $35”. The app sends an alert when the dressing room is ready, and the phone unlocks the dressing room door. The dressing rooms are bright and clean, with a glowing lightstrip around the mirror and a message welcoming them by name on a touchscreen. Details about the customers’ selected clothes are on the screen, as well as a list of new clothing picks, including recommendations for matching tops, shoes and bags to “finish the look”. Swiping through outfit options on a touch screen is an experience straight out of Clueless, though it remains to be seen whether Amazon’s algorithm will create Cher-inspired looks. The main gimmick of Amazon Style is what one corporate director has called the “magic closet” in the fitting rooms. Close the door on the empty closet, press a few buttons on the touchscreen, and wait. A warning light will glow red, there will be some rustlings in the closet and then a sudden glow of light around the door: open it, and the clothes requested are there. Amazon makes sure to keep the workers who fill its new magic closets out of sight: the “closet” door locks from the fitting room side when employees are at work in the closet, for shoppers’ privacy, according to a sign in the dressing room. The closet’s back door, to the employee side, is also locked from the inside. Amazon touts that its quick clothing delivery is made possible through the “advanced technologies and processes used in Amazon fulfillment centers,” which have also made headlines for years for grueling working conditions and high injury rates. So far, Amazon has not let the public see what is happening in the rooms on the other side of its “magic closets”. An Amazon press spokesperson declined a request for a behind-the-scenes tour. Asked about working conditions behind the scenes at Amazon Style, the company touted what it called its competitive pay and good benefits, and said that the store’s employees have the ability to try different roles throughout the store. The human element When Amazon announced its new clothing store concept in January, ahead of the store’s official launch, some critics saw it as an attempt to make human sales associates obsolete. Many big box clothing stores are understaffed, and their employees stretched too thin to provide many personal recommendations, Rachel Kraus wrote in Mashable, which meant that Amazon’s algorithmic shopping could be a better option for some customers. At the same time, Kraus argued, “I’m not sure an app telling me I’d look great in this top would give me the confidence boost that’s all part of the fun of in-person shopping.” In a statement, Amazon said that its front-of-store employees, who provide customers with human recommendations and assistance, were essential to the Amazon Style experience, and would continue to be part of the store’s operations, even as customers grew more accustomed to using the shopping app. The Glendale store currently employs hundreds of people, many of them with previous experience in the clothing industry, Amazon said. Because employees at the front of the store did not have to spend time restocking sizes on the floor, it suggested, employees would have more time to interact with customers and provide recommendations. Customers who had browsed inside the new California store this month praised the friendly front-of-store employees, though many were divided on whether they liked the overall concept: some said they found it “really cool” and innovative, others the experience was overwhelming, and some said the in-store clothing selection was underwhelming compared with what they could find online. Sanders, the 28-year-old, had not been a huge Amazon shopper previously, but said he planned to encourage his friends to try the store. Inside his fitting room, Amazon’s algorithm offered Sanders items similar to what he had already picked – “two expensive things and two cheaper things” – and he ended up purchasing one of them, he said, without even realizing he had done so. Le said the “anti-social” aspect of the store appealed to her, but wasn’t a big fan of the quality of Amazon’s clothes. And she saw deeper problems: the store’s “cool concept” was also “classist” and “causes a lot of disparities”, since people without smartphones would not be able to shop. An Amazon spokesperson said that people without smartphones are welcome to shop in the store, and that they would be assisted by a store employee throughout the shopping process. This article was amended on 18 July to add comment from Amazon about the option to shop in the store without a smartphone.","Amazon makes sure to keep the workers who fill its new magic closets out of sight: the “closet” door locks from the fitting room side when employees are at work in the closet, for shoppers’ privacy, according to a sign in the dressing room.

133,133,"The largest US cryptomining companies have the capacity to use as much electricity as nearly every home in Houston, Texas; energy use that is contributing to rising utility bills, according to an investigation by Democratic lawmakers. Cryptomining is a highly energy intensive process involving the use of specialized computers running constantly to solve complex math problems in order to create new virtual coins. Energy use in the industry is greater than that of entire countries. The US has become the center of cryptomining after it was banned in China. More than a third of the global computing power dedicated to mining bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, comes from the US, Senator Elizabeth Warren and five other Democrats reported in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency. “The results of our investigation … are disturbing … revealing that cryptominers are large energy users that account for a significant – and rapidly growing – amount of carbon emissions,” the letter states. “It is imperative that your agencies work together to address the lack of information about cryptomining’s energy use and environmental impacts.” The congressional Democrats have asked the EPA and the Department of Energy to require cryptominers to disclose emissions and energy use, noting that regulators know little about the full environmental impact of the industry. The lawmakers solicited information from seven of the largest US cryptomining companies, including Stronghold, Greenidge, Bit Digital, Bitfury, Riot, BitDeer and Marathon, about their energy sources and consumption and the climate impacts of their operations. The data revealed that the industry is using a substantial amount of electricity, ramping up production and creating significant carbon emissions at a time when the US needs to drastically reduce emissions to combat the climate crisis. Emissions data from three companies, Bit Digital, Greenidge and Stronghold, indicated their operations create 1.6m tons of CO2 annually, an amount produced by nearly 360,000 cars. Their environmental impact is significant despite industry claims about clean energy use and climate commitments, the lawmakers wrote. “Bitcoin miners are using huge quantities of electricity that could be used for other priority end uses that contribute to our electrification and climate goals, such as replacing home furnaces with heat pumps,” the letter states. “The current energy use of cryptomining is resulting in large amounts of carbon emissions and other adverse air quality impacts, as well as impacts to the electric grid.” The power demands of the industry are also coming at a cost to consumers, the letter states, citing a study that found cryptomining operations in upstate New York led to a rise in electric bills by roughly $165m for small businesses and $79m for individuals. In Texas, which has become a cryptomining hub, the industry is expected to continue to expand significantly in the coming years, increasing the amount of electrical load to nearly a third of the grid’s current maximum capacity over the next four years and straining the system, according to a report from the Verge. “The more crypto mining that comes into the state, the higher the residents should expect the electricity prices to become,” Eric Hittinger, a professor at Rochester Institute of Technology, told the outlet.

134,134,"Name: Workplace emojis. Age: 25. The first set of emojis hit Japanese phones in 1997. Appearance: Ever more various, including a heatwave-appropriate “melting face”, and multiracial handshakes in the latest release. OK, but why did you just email me a yellow waving hand? Just being friendly with a colleague. Hmph. I loathe emojis. They are an infantilising impoverishment of language. Have you ever considered you might be the one with impoverished language? In a recent survey of 9,400 workers worldwide by the messaging platform Slack and the language app Duolingo, 58% of respondents said they would consider an emoji-less work message “lacking”. Do you never use emojis at work? Never. Well, I have very occasionally succumbed to the skull. And what do you use it for? Death, pestilence, an oblique commentary on Alan from marketing’s poorly formatted PowerPoints. This is a case in point: younger workers often use the skull to convey that something is “dead funny”. The survey found that generational differences in how we use and interpret emojis are creating all sorts of awkwardness and misunderstanding. For instance, what do you think a classic smiley means? Presumably it expresses satisfaction, perhaps at the felicitous wording of a memo? Not for the 9% of people (and 20% of Americans) who use it for “deep exasperation and/or distrust”. How about the aubergine? If pressed, I would use it to inform people that my legendary baba ganoush is available in the third-floor kitchen. This is where some of the worst problems arise: older workers sending colleagues emojis that are distinctly not safe for work. A winky face is considered not just jokey but flirtatious by younger people, and anything with a tongue, peach, taco or aubergine is strongly discouraged. But this is going to play havoc with working lunches. Basically, it’s best to avoid any emoji that could be misunderstood, or make you seem creepy and inappropriate to younger colleagues. I see. Is this a bit like David Cameron using LOL for “lots of love”? Sure, an excellent, up-to-date analogy. 🙃 Hang on, is that sarcasm? 🤐 There’s an easy solution to this problem: stick to the language of Shakespeare in work communication. The same Shakespeare who wrote a famously filthy innuendo involving fruit (medlar and pear) in Romeo and Juliet? No, the 🧞 is out of the 🍾 with pictograms in work communication. “People from various countries and cultures … need emoji to help convey subtle meanings in real-time, often high-stakes situations,” says Hope Wilson, Duolingo’s learning and curriculum manager. Can you do a Duolingo course in emojis now? You can. Might be worth signing up? 😉 Do say: “The feedback on your annual appraisal is 😍 🎇 🥂 🎉.” Don’t say: “We are delighted to present our annual report: 🤪 🍆 💦.”","In a recent survey of 9,400 workers worldwide by the messaging platform Slack and the language app Duolingo, 58% of respondents said they would consider an emoji-less work message “lacking”.

135,135,"Twitter has won the first legal skirmish in its attempt to force Elon Musk to complete a $44bn (£36.7bn) takeover of the social media company, after a judge ruled that a trial will take place in October. Legal experts said the ruling in Delaware was good news for Twitter, which had asked for a fast-track process to settle the dispute. A Delaware judge said there was a “cloud of uncertainty” hanging over Twitter and accepted the company’s argument that a delay would cause severe damage to the business. “Delay threatens irreparable harm,” said Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, the head judge of Delaware’s court of chancery. “The longer the delay, the greater the risk.” McCormick added that the court was able to “quickly process complex litigation.” Twitter is ultimately seeking a legal verdict that will force Musk to go ahead with an agreed transaction that values the company at $54.20 per share. Musk pulled out of the deal this month, citing concerns over the number of spam accounts on the social media platform. A lawyer representing Twitter at the virtual hearing accused Musk of “attempted sabotage”. “He’s doing his best to run Twitter down,” said attorney William Savitt. On 8 July, Musk said he was terminating the deal for three broad reasons: Twitter had breached the agreement by failing to provide enough information on spam accounts; that it had misrepresented the number of spam accounts in its disclosures to the US financial watchdog; and that it had breached the agreement by failing to consult with him when firing senior employees recently. Musk’s attorney, Andrew Rossman, said the accusation that Musk was trying to damage the business was “preposterous”. “He has no interest in damaging the company,” said Rossman, noting the the Tesla chief is Twitter’s second largest shareholder with a far larger stake – at more than 9% – than the entire board. Savitt emphasized the importance of an expedited trial for Twitter to be able to make important business decisions affecting everything from employee retention to relationships with suppliers and customers. He also pointed out that the debt financing supporting the deal expires on 25 April next year, hastening the need for a swift legal resolution. Rossman said more time is needed because it is “one of the largest take-private deals in history” involving a “company that has a massive amount of data that has to be analyzed. Billions of actions on their platform have to be analyzed.” The quicker legal process now gives Musk less time to assemble analysis backing his argument that Twitter has underestimated spam account numbers. McCormick asked the parties to work out the schedule for the October trial, which she said would last five days. Legal observers said the ruling was a boost for Twitter, which is demanding that Musk be held to a legal agreement struck in April to buy the business. “This is a good sign for Twitter,” said Robert Frenchman, a partner at New York law firm Mukasey Frenchman. “The last thing Twitter wants is a long drawn-out fight about the counting and combatting of spam bots, issues that are only tangentially relevant to whether Twitter breached its obligations under the stock purchase agreement.” Commenting on the ruling, Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College law school, said the ruling was a victory for Twitter, which had been seeking a September trial in Delaware, the US state that is its corporate base. “That’s a win for Twitter. The court granted expedition, not exactly on Twitter’s very aggressive schedule, but very close. October for trial isn’t all that far away and the lawyers will have a lot to do to prep for trial.” Twitter’s argument for closing the deal is encapsulated in its 62-page lawsuit against Musk, in which it argues that the world’s richest man has no proof that its spam accounts are more than 5% of its daily active user base, that it has cooperated with his requests for information related to the spam issues and that its firing of employees was part of the normal course of running the business. Carl Tobias, Williams chair in law at the university of Richmond, said both sides could decide to settle “because as case will consume much time and energy, and distract Twitter and Musk from smoothly operating their essential businesses”. He added that a trial could tarnish both sides. “It may also undermine the parties’ reputations and cause the value of the companies’ stocks to decrease.” Shares in Twitter rose 2.8% in early afternoon trading to $39.48 on Tuesday.","“The longer the delay, the greater the risk.” McCormick added that the court was able to “quickly process complex litigation.” Twitter is ultimately seeking a legal verdict that will force Musk to go ahead with an agreed transaction that values the company at $54.20 per share.

136,136,"Watch out Huw Edwards, the TikTokers are coming. The social video platform is the fastest growing news source for UK adults, according to a survey, but nearly half of people using it for current affairs turn to fellow TikTokers rather than conventional news organisations for their updates. TikTok is used by 7% of adults for news, according to the UK’s communications watchdog, up from 1% in 2020. The growth is primarily driven by young users, with half of its news followers aged 16 to 24. Ofcom’s annual report on news consumption in the UK showed that for teenagers aged 12-15, Instagram has deposed BBC One and BBC Two as the most popular news source among teenagers, closely followed by TikTok and YouTube. “Teenagers today are increasingly unlikely to pick up a newspaper or tune into TV News, instead preferring to keep up-to-date by scrolling through their social feeds,” said Yih-Choung Teh, Ofcom’s group director for strategy and research. “And while youngsters find news on social media to be less reliable, they rate these services more highly for serving up a range of opinions on the day’s topical stories.” The Ofcom study showed that news organisations are having to compete with non-journalist TikTokers as a news source on the platform. For those who consume news on TikTok, their main source is other people they follow (44%), followed by friends and family (32%) and then news organisations (24%). The most popular official news sources on TikTok include Sky News, the BBC and ITV. TikTok has more than 1 billion users worldwide and is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese tech company. Its power as a news source has come to the fore during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with the White House briefing 30 influential TikTokers on the war. Despite TikTok’s growth in the UK as a news source, it appears to lag the US. A quarter of US adults say they always use TikTok to get the news, with nearly half of US millennial and Gen Z adults – under-41s and under-25s respectively – indicating the same, according to the analysis firm Forrester Research. There have also been warnings that the platform has been susceptible to misinformation and disinformation during the conflict, with examples including video game clips passed off as real footage and the mislabelling of footage to give the impression that Russia is readying for a nuclear attack. Disinformation is the deliberate distribution of false information that intends to cause harm, whereas misinformation is when false information is shared but no harm is meant. The app also became a highly popular source of coverage for the defamation case brought by Johnny Depp against his ex-wife Amber Heard in the US, with the platform’s videos appearing to skew heavily in favour of Depp, who ultimately won the case. On TikTok videos posted with the #JusticeForJohnnyDepp hashtag gained more than 20bn views in two months, while the derogatory #AmberTurd had billions of views. Nic Newman, a senior research associate at the Reuters Institute for the Study Journalism, said the institute’s own research indicated that TikTok was not used as a platform for serious news. “Even young people, mostly, don’t see it as a platform for serious news. But they see it as a good place to get news about celebrity or issues that are not about life and death. They will often use TikTok in combination with traditional news when something really big happens like the war in Ukraine,” he said. The Ofcom survey showed that only three out of 10 people who use TikTok for news view it as a trustworthy source. Fanbytes, a UK-based generation Z marketing agency, said TikTok creators like Matt Welland and Dylan Page were making news “more accessible”. “Tiktok shouldn’t be viewed only as an entertainment platform. It is an active participant in popular culture, with people using the platform to be updated on social movements and news affairs,” said Emily Hall, a campaign manager at Fanbytes. A TikTok spokesperson said the platform was a place where “millions of people come to be entertained and learn”, adding: “We want everyone who uses TikTok to have access to good and accurate information, which is why our community guidelines makes clear we do not allow harmful misinformation.” The Ofcom report shows, however, that TikTok remains far behind conventional news sources and one social media powerhouse in particular. BBC One remains the most popular news source among adults (53%), followed by ITV (35%) and then Facebook (32%), which remains the most popular social media source for news (32%). Among newspapers, the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday are the most popular (15%) followed by the Guardian and Observer (10%). Ofcom found that younger age groups are much more likely to use the internet and social media for news, whereas their older counterparts favour print, radio and TV.","“And while youngsters find news on social media to be less reliable, they rate these services more highly for serving up a range of opinions on the day’s topical stories.” The Ofcom study showed that news organisations are having to compete with non-journalist TikTokers as a news source on the platform.

137,137,"Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of the Facebook parent company Meta, will face a six-hour deposition over the way the company handled user data relating to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, according to new court filings. The deposition comes as part of a lawsuit filed in a California court on behalf of Facebook users impacted by the platform’s partnership with Cambridge Analytica, a consulting firm accused of manipulating user data. As the Guardian revealed in 2018, the company had partnered with the Donald Trump campaign team and gained access to the private data of 50 million Facebook users, which was used to profile voters. The company also played a role in the 2016 Brexit referendum in the UK. Sheryl Sandberg, who stepped down as chief operating officer of the platform in June, will also face more than five hours of deposition interviews as part of the discovery process. Her successor in the role, Javier Olivan, has also been named in the suit and could face up to three hours of deposition. The depositions are scheduled to take place over the next two months, and could feature other witnesses including Facebook privacy officer Rob Sherman, former director of product management Eddie O’Neil, and platform partnership executive Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, according to filings. In a civil case, a witness who testifies at a deposition is under oath, with a court reporter transcribing everything the witness says. Typically, the deposition is taken at the law firm of the party seeking the deposition. Because the testimony is delivered under oath, the witness is testifying under the penalty of perjury. Robert Frenchman, a partner at the New York law firm Mukasey Frenchman, said the use of time limits is unusual in depositions taken in civil cases, but lawyers representing the plaintiffs would be happy for the opportunity to depose the CEO and former COO. “Plaintiffs savor the opportunity to cross-examine C-suite executives, and they’ll have free rein on a broad range of topics. For the corporate defendant, there is far more to lose than gain,” he said. Throughout the discovery process for the case, plaintiffs have obtained thousands of exhibits from the company going back 13 years. Facebook has pushed back against the extensive investigation, accusing plaintiffs in a court filing of “constant and continuing overreach”. The suit could reveal new details in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which rocked the company’s public reputation and led to congressional hearings in which Zuckerberg was grilled for hours over Facebook’s data privacy policies. The company agreed to a record $5bn fine from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2019 over the scandal, but critics have pushed for more legal accountability, noting that financial consequences mean little for the massive firm. Meta reported $118bn (£99bn) in revenue in 2021. Facebook has been hit with a number of lawsuits relating to the case, including four in just one week of 2018. This suit is the first to include extensive depositions from high-level Facebook executives. Plaintiffs are seeking up to $5m in damages.

138,138,"What’s the problem with TikTok? It’s a harder question to answer than it seems. The social video app, which has joined Facebook/Instagram, YouTube and Twitter in the list of societally important social networks, is frequently spoken about with an air of suspicion, and it’s not hard to guess why: the app’s Chinese roots loom large in the conversation. (ByteDance, which owns TikTok, insists that it is headquartered in the Cayman Islands, one of the only instances I’ve seen of a company deciding that loudly proclaiming its paper HQ is located in a tax haven is preferable to the alternative). But sometimes, it can feel like the cart leading the horse. The app has Chinese roots, therefore it must be suspicious – right? So I was interested to read a report that attempts to look at the general suspicion of the service. Published on Monday by the Australian-US cybersecurity firm Internet 2.0, it is based on a teardown of TikTok’s Android and iOS apps. The report’s author, Thomas Perkins, writes: In our analysis, the TikTok mobile application does not prioritise privacy. Permissions and device information collection are overly intrusive and not necessary for the application to function. Also of note is that TikTok IOS 25.1.1 has a server connection to mainland China which is run by a top 100 Chinese cyber security and data company Guizhou Baishan Cloud Technology Co Ltd. Perkins’ report offers a dizzying list of data the TikTok app can access while it’s running, including the device location, calendar, contacts, other running applications, wi-fi networks, phone number and even the SIM card serial number. He concludes: For the TikTok application to function properly, most of the access and device data collection is not required. This leads us to believe that the only reason this information has been gathered is for data harvesting. It is also notable that the device only needs to ask the user for permission to perform each of these actions once and then follow the user’s preferences. The application however has a culture of persistent access or continuously asking for a decision reversal by the user. The hourly checking of location is also unnecessary. Finally, device mapping, external storage access, contacts and third-party applications data collection allows TikTok the ability to reimage the phone in the likeness of the original device. The most alarming finding in the report is that unexplained connection to a server that Perkins locates in mainland China, run by Guizhou BaishanCloud Technology Co Ltd. When the Guardian asked TikTok about the findings, it dismissed the report. The server connection it specifically rejected, with a spokesman saying that the IP address listed “is in Singapore, the network traffic does not leave the region, and it is categorically untrue to imply there is communication with China. “The researcher’s conclusions reveal fundamental misunderstandings of how mobile apps work and, by their own admission, they do not have the correct testing environment to confirm their baseless claims,” the spokesperson said. On data collection, the company said: “The TikTok app is not unique in the amount of information it collects, which is less than many popular mobile apps. In line with industry practices, we collect information that users choose to provide to us and information that helps the app function, operate securely, and improve the user experience. Also, like our peers, we constantly update our app to keep up with evolving security challenges and encourage our users to download the most current version of TikTok.” Here’s the thing: I believe them. The problem with TikTok is not its aggressive data collection – or, if it is, it’s not a problem unique to TikTok. Surveillance capitalism is almost a cliche at this point, but download any random game from the Android App Store and you’ll find a similar level of data being harvested in order to enable the targeted advertising that monetises the service. A significant chunk of this data is collected to enable “fingerprinting” – the ability to track users from app to app. That’s what Apple tried to cut down on when it started offering users the ability to opt-out of being tracked across apps, by setting one specific tracking ID – the “IDFA” token – to zero for users who request it. But fingerprinting can get sneaky, fast: I’ve covered attempts to track devices using the fonts installed on a device, the remaining battery, and even how bright the room is. All of this is to say that if you have a problem with TikTok’s ad and tracking tech, you probably have a problem with the wider software ecosystem in 2022. When the company does go further than its peers, it gets pushback: plans from earlier this year to target users with personalised adverts regardless of explicit consent were scrapped following outcry. There are elements of TikTok’s tracking that are more unique to the service. Perkins’ report highlights the company’s insistence that users provide access to their contacts field, noting that “if the user denies access, it continuously requests for access until the user gives access.” This is part of TikTok’s “growth hacking” approach, a set of policies and approaches geared towards maximising user acquisition. By receiving your contacts list, TikTok can recommend you follow people you know; can kickstart its algorithmic personalisation by feeding in data about what your friends like; in turn, it can boost your friends’ use of the app by letting them know when a pal has signed up. None of this is new, but TikTok’s approach to growth hacking is quite a bit more aggressive than its peers: no other major app, for instance, actively encourages users to follow the friend who sent them a link to a post, as TikTok does. Again, though, the persistent criticism of TikTok is rather stronger than “it practices growth hacking to an extent that is unseemly”. I think the problem TikTok’s critics have is fundamentally one of trying to ram a square peg into a round hole. Even if you start from the assumption that a Chinese social media app becoming a major player in American culture is inherently problematic – which isn’t an unreasonable assumption – the problems with that power aren’t to do with the data the app has access to. It’s possible to draw up totally wild, action movie-style plot where TikTok’s data could pose a geopolitical risk to the west. What if, say, the prime minister’s son takes to posting private videos of his parents’ movements that can then be analysed by the People’s Liberation Army to set up a perfect cyberattack? In practice, though, the value of data harvesting to TikTok is the same as the value to Facebook, Google and all the other tech giants that it sits alongside: it makes the company money. I don’t mean to sound blase. I’ve covered TikTok closely for years, and broke the story three years ago that the company’s moderation guidelines, written in China, required western teams to censor stories about Tiananmen Square or Tibetan independence. (TikTok said at the time that those guidelines were already out of date, and in the years since, its approach to political topics has changed greatly.) But since then, I’ve become convinced that looking for the smoking gun that will prove the social video app is a danger to the west is a fool’s errand. The problem with TikTok is no more and no less than the fact that it is a tremendously influential and important app, owned by a Chinese company. There is no technical data that will answer the question of whether that level of social and cultural power “should” be in the hands of a company with roots in a geopolitical opponent.

139,139,"Shares in Snapchat’s parent company have fallen 25% after it confirmed investors’ fears of a slowdown in advertising revenue for social media firms. Snap painted a grim picture of the effects of a weakening economy on social media in quarterly results on Thursday and declined to make a revenue forecast in “incredibly challenging” conditions, hitting its share price in after hours trading and setting off a chain reaction among listed rivals. Snap, which generates more than two-thirds of its revenue in North America, said some advertisers continued to face supply-chain disruptions and labour shortages, and many others were contending with rising costs amid record inflation, which has led to cuts in spending on advertising. Snap’s revenue for the second quarter ending on 30 June was $1.11bn (£930m), missing analyst expectations of $1.14bn, which pushed its shares down by a quarter to $12.33. The figure grew 13% from the prior-year quarter. Snap said revenue in the current third quarter was flat compared with the prior year. Daily active users on Snapchat rose 18% year-over-year to 347 million, beating consensus estimates of 344 million users. Mike Proulx, a research director at analysis firm Forrester, said: “While the platform’s user base remains strong, Snap’s ad-centric model is no longer a sure bet and is especially volatile heading into a period of economic headwinds where marketers are sure to pull back their ad spend.” The California-based company said it would significantly slow hiring, invest in its advertising business and find new sources of revenue in order to grow at a faster pace. Advertising is Snap’s main source of revenue. It recently launched a premium service called Snapchat Plus, which costs $3.99/£3.99 a month and offers features such as the ability to message friends from your desktop. Facebook owner Meta, Google owner Alphabet and other companies that sell online ads lost about $80bn in combined stock market value on Thursday after Snap’s results. The company is normally one of the first of the social media firms to report second-quarter earnings and is viewed as a bellwether for similar stocks. Investors are expecting the slowest-ever pace of growth for social media ad revenue this year, as rising inflation and other economic woes cause brands to slash their marketing budgets. Twitter, mired in a legal dispute with would-be suitor Elon Musk, reports results later on Friday. Tech stocks have been hit this year as rising inflation around the world has combined with interest rate increases from central banks to rattle investors. Advertising has not been the only factor in their decline. Tech stocks, the price of which can be based on expectations of strong future earnings over many decades, can be relatively less appealing than the immediate fixed returns on offer from investments such as bonds, which become more attractive in a higher lending rate environment. So far this year, shares in Meta have fallen 46%, with Alphabet down by 21%, Apple by 15% and Netflix by 62%. “We are not satisfied with the results we are delivering, regardless of the current headwinds,” said Snap. Recent privacy changes on iPhones, macroeconomic challenges and increasing competition for a pool of advertising dollars that is growing more slowly all contributed to “substantially slowed” revenue growth, Snap said. Snap has been investing heavily in augmented reality technology and ads, which overlays digital images on to photos and videos of the real world. Snap’s chief executive, Evan Spiegel, and the chief technology officer, Bobby Murphy, have agreed to serve in their roles through to at least 1 January 2027, for a $1 salary and no stock-based remuneration, the company said. Both own significant stakes in the company.","Snap painted a grim picture of the effects of a weakening economy on social media in quarterly results on Thursday and declined to make a revenue forecast in “incredibly challenging” conditions, hitting its share price in after hours trading and setting off a chain reaction among listed rivals. Snap, which generates more than two-thirds of its revenue in North America, said some advertisers continued to face supply-chain disruptions and labour shortages, and many others were contending with rising costs amid record inflation, which has led to cuts in spending on advertising. Mike Proulx, a research director at analysis firm Forrester, said: “While the platform’s user base remains strong, Snap’s ad-centric model is no longer a sure bet and is especially volatile heading into a period of economic headwinds where marketers are sure to pull back their ad spend.” The California-based company said it would significantly slow hiring, invest in its advertising business and find new sources of revenue in order to grow at a faster pace.

Google, which placed software engineer Blake Lemoine on leave last month, said he had violated company policies and that it found his claims on LaMDA (language model for dialogue applications) to be “wholly unfounded”. “It’s regrettable that despite lengthy engagement on this topic, Blake still chose to persistently violate clear employment and data security policies that include the need to safeguard product information,” Google said. Last year, Google said LaMDA was built on the company’s research showing transformer-based language models trained on dialogue could learn to talk about essentially anything.

He said LaMDA engaged him in conversations about rights and personhood, and Lemoine shared his findings with company executives in April in a GoogleDoc entitled “Is LaMDA sentient?” The engineer compiled a transcript of the conversations, in which at one point he asks the AI system what it is afraid of. Google and many leading scientists were quick to dismiss Lemoine’s views as misguided, saying LaMDA is simply a complex algorithm designed to generate convincing human language.

141,141,"My father, John Marston, who has died aged 87, was a dynamic and inspiring businessman, civil engineer, adventuring sailor and longstanding educational governor. His drive was always to find ways for individuals to fulfil their potential – he managed this through the running of the family businesses, promotion of apprenticeships and support for numerous charities. Born in Wandsworth, south-west London, he was the son of Elsie (nee Shepherd) and John Marston, who ran the family construction company WJ Marston &amp; Son, set up by his grandfather, William Marston. John Jr went to Dulwich college, in south London, then Rugby school. After completing an engineering degree at Manchester University in 1957, he worked as a young engineer for Costain. Diverse projects ranged from laying out the new M20 motorway in Kent to building an aircraft refuelling stop in the middle of the Indian Ocean, on Gan in the Maldives, with a runway longer than the island itself. After joining the family company, John managed many of WJ Marston’s diverse construction projects for the next four decades: schools, hotels, Tottenham Hale tube station, the Kingston School of Architecture, London Oratory school and numerous residential and commercial developments in south London. Concurrent with his work career, John enjoyed a social and playing life as a tight head prop with Shirley Wanderers Rugby Club, whose members distinguished themselves by stealing the Twickenham crossbar after the 1965 Varsity match in an incident that made the national papers, before negotiating its safe return. His achievements include guiding Marston Hotels to become the largest independent hotel group within Best Western UK, winning AA hotel group of the year 2004, before the company was sold in 2006. He served for 25 years as governor at the further education institution Hammersmith College (now West London College), for which he was appointed MBE, and was chair of the Putney Sea Cadets. A lifelong sailor – both racing and cruising – he owned the 20-ton classic Clyde yacht Tigris long before her glamorous St Tropez race triumphs; in John’s ownership she was cruised to Africa and back. Later in life his enthusiasm for others to succeed was channelled into a passion for philanthropy – support for the Woodland Trust that saved many ancient woods and created new ones; for Manchester University, who created a Marston doctoral scholarship in audiology, as well as funding pioneering graphene research; and for the Jubilee Sailing Trust to launch their second sail training ship Tenacious. John was a believer in enterprise and not all his investments were successful. “I am more of an opportunist than a long-term planner,” he wrote. “Once you have completed something, move on.” In 1964 he married Mette Dahl. She survives him, along with his children, Nicola and Andrew, and five grandchildren.","Diverse projects ranged from laying out the new M20 motorway in Kent to building an aircraft refuelling stop in the middle of the Indian Ocean, on Gan in the Maldives, with a runway longer than the island itself.

142,142,"Alphabet only narrowly missed estimates for its quarterly revenue on Tuesday, a sign the tech giant may weather an industry-wide slowdown better than expected. Alphabet reported second-quarter revenue of $69.69bn, 13% higher than same period a year ago, and nearly in line with the average expectation of $69.88bn among investment researchers tracked by Refinitiv. The news heartened Wall Street, with shares in the company up 3% after hours. The results gave investors hope that Alphabet’s search and advertising business might be able to withstand big countries potentially going into recession over the next year. Still, Alphabet’s results marked the latest sign that tailwinds propelling big technology companies during the pandemic have shifted. The array of new challenges facing the industry has already caused the tech-driven Nasdaq composite index to plummet by 26% so far this year. Alphabet’s report would mark impressive growth for most companies outside of tech. But it marked Alphabet’s lowest growth rate since the the April-June quarter of 2020, when the company suffered the only year-over-year revenue decline in its history. In a call with investors on Tuesday, Alphabet’s chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, addressed the growing headwinds, saying it was difficult to make comparisons to the “significant growth rate” of the last year. “There is uncertainty in the global economic environment and issues across the industry, whether it’s supply chain or inventory,” she said. Google announced on 20 July it would implement a several-week hiring freeze, “to enable teams to prioritize their roles and hiring plans for the rest of the year”. The move was widely interpreted as a worrying sign, not only for Alphabet but also for the wider industry, as tech giants’ behavior is often seen as an economic bellwether. Despite the freeze, Alphabet did make a significant number of hires in the quarter, adding more than 10,000 employees from the end of March through June. The company ended the quarter with about 174,000 employees worldwide. Porat addressed the hiring slowdown on the earnings call, saying the company would “continue hiring for critical roles, particularly focused on top engineering and technical talent” but that “the pace of headcount will moderate next year”. In light of these changes, analysts had braced themselves for negative results from Alphabet, as rising inflation has influenced ad buyers to spend less on marketing. Alphabet, like others in the tech industry, has struggled to maintain the huge growth it saw during the pandemic, when much of life moved online. Fears were bolstered by recent difficult earnings reports from tech firms including Snap, Twitter and Netflix – many of which are also stopping or slowing hiring. Overall profit was $16bn, or $1.21 per share, compared with the average estimate of $1.29 per share. Alphabet’s profit tends to be unpredictable due to sporadic gains or losses – at least on paper – in the stakes it holds in many startups. Still, within the $602bn global online ad industry, Google is expected to maintain market share of 29%, or the biggest share for the 12th straight year, according to Insider Intelligence. “With its tremendous market share in search advertising, Google is relatively well positioned to weather the rough waters that lie ahead as advertisers prioritize lower-funnel tactics,” said Evelyn Mitchell, an analyst at Insider Intelligence. Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report","But it marked Alphabet’s lowest growth rate since the the April-June quarter of 2020, when the company suffered the only year-over-year revenue decline in its history.

143,143,"Instagram is reversing some changes to the app following a user backlash that saw influencer royalty Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian turning on the platform. The photo and video sharing app was accused of mimicking TikTok at the expense of its most loyal users, after user anger at a series of changes boiled over this week. Instagram said on Thursday it was rolling back some of the changes including a test version of the app that gave a full-screen display to posts. It will also tone down changes to its algorithm that resulted in users’ feeds being deluged with videos from accounts they do not follow. “I’m glad we took a risk – if we’re not failing every once in a while, we’re not thinking big enough or bold enough,” said Instagram’s head, Adam Mosseri, in an interview with tech newsletter Platformer. “But we definitely need to take a big step back and regroup. [When] we’ve learned a lot, then we come back with some sort of new idea or iteration. So we’re going to work through that.” Rumblings among some of Instagram’s more than 1 billion users came to a head on Monday when Jenner, the app’s third most followed user with 361 million followers joined her sister Kim Kardashian, the seventh biggest with 326 million, in sharing a meme that demanded “Make Instagram Instagram Again.” The meme added: “stop trying to be tiktok i just want to see cute photos of my friends.” People who used the platform to interact with friends and family also complained that their feeds had been flooded with unwanted videos. The backlash prompted Mosseri to post a video on Tuesday – which he said was recorded before he saw the Kardashian posts – in which he said “more and more of Instagram is going to become video over time”. But by Thursday he had conceded that Instagram had gone too far. “For the new feed designs, people are frustrated and the usage data isn’t great,” he told Platformer. “So there I think that we need to take a big step back, regroup, and figure out how we want to move forward.” Mosseri added that Instagram would reduce the amount of recommended posts after users complained about being pushed content from accounts they do not follow. “When you discover something in your field that you didn’t follow before, there should be a high bar – it should just be great,” Mosseri said. “You should be delighted to see it. And I don’t think that’s happening enough right now. So I think we need to take a step back, in terms of the percentage of feed that are recommendations.” The Daily Show host, Trevor Noah, was among the critics of the recommendations change, saying: “Everything is an ad, and your feed is full of people you don’t follow.” The emergence of TikTok, which has more than 1 billion users worldwide, has challenged the established order in social media. In a permanent change announced by Instagram last week that will not be reversed, it said all videos posted on Instagram will become “Reels”, the app’s TikTok-style video feature. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, Instagram’s parent company and also the owner of Facebook, on Wednesday reported a 30% increase in time spent on Reels. However, it also reported its first year-on-year decline in quarterly revenue, for the April-June period, a fall it blamed on macroeconomic conditions.","So we’re going to work through that.” Rumblings among some of Instagram’s more than 1 billion users came to a head on Monday when Jenner, the app’s third most followed user with 361 million followers joined her sister Kim Kardashian, the seventh biggest with 326 million, in sharing a meme that demanded “Make Instagram Instagram Again.” The meme added: “stop trying to be tiktok i just want to see cute photos of my friends.” People who used the platform to interact with friends and family also complained that their feeds had been flooded with unwanted videos.

144,144,"Apple reported higher-than-expected profit and sales as demand for iPhones holds steady even amid inflation and the challenges of an economic slowdown. Sales and profit for the quarter were $83bn and $1.20 a share, according to Apple, surpassing Wall Street expectations. The report is a positive sign for the company, which earlier this year lost its status as the most valuable company in the world to the oil giant Saudi Aramco. The company’s shares rose by 2.6% after hours in response to the news. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, described the quarter as a reflection of the company’s “resilience and optimism” and said it managed to achieve better than expected results despite supply constraints and the effects of the company suspending sales in Russia. There has been no slowdown in demand for iPhones, Apple’s CFO, Luca Maestri, told Reuters. Apple reported iPhone sales were $40.7bn, up about 3% from a year earlier and well ahead of the overall global smartphone market. The company’s loyal and affluent customer base has in the past allowed it to weather economic dips better than some other companies. But the slowing economy is hurting sales of advertising, accessories and home products, Maestri said. “Fortunately, we have a very broad portfolio, so we know we’re going to be able to navigate that,” he said. Parts shortages will continue to limit Mac and iPad sales, Maestri said, though the impact has been easing. “As a largely hardware company, Apple is arguably more directly exposed to supply chain issues than the other tech giants reporting earnings this week, but it also has a growing services business that is an important part of its diversification strategy, so it has flex in its model,” Tom Johnson, the global chief digital officer at Mindshare Worldwide, said of Apple’s quarterly earnings. In April, Apple warned it expected a growth slowdown despite its stronger-than-anticipated quarterly results. The company has struggled with Covid shutdowns at factories in China and a computer chip shortage. Apple has managed to maintain greater stability than other tech giants that have announced hiring slowdowns and layoffs. But the company does plan to slow hiring and spending next year in an effort to be more cautious as an expected recession looms, Bloomberg reported this month. “Apple’s move reflects a broader slowdown in investing in new things, new companies and new products,” Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners, told Reuters. “It signifies that inflation is an issue for these companies.” Google, Microsoft and Meta have announced plans to slow hiring or cut jobs. Tesla’s Elon Musk has said the company will cut 10% of its workforce while Netflix, which lost 1 million subscribers earlier this year, laid off 300 employees. After seeing record profits during the pandemic, the industry as a whole has struggled for months amid rising interest rates, inflation and sluggish economic growth. The tech-driven Nasdaq composite index has already fallen by 26% this year. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, reported higher revenue than last year, suggesting the company may weather a slow economy better than anticipated. Meanwhile, Meta reported that it projected the first decline in its revenue since the company went public.

145,145,"Apple should take heed of warnings from the UK’s security services and revive its controversial plans to scan iPhones for child abuse imagery, the inventor of the scanning technology has argued. Prof Hany Farid, an expert in image analysis at University of California, Berkeley, is the inventor of PhotoDNA, an “image hashing” technique used by companies across the web to identify and remove illegal images. He said that, following an intervention from the technical leads of GCHQ and the National Cyber Security Centre backing an extension of the technology on to individual phones, Apple should be emboldened to revive its shelved plans to do just that. “The pushback was from a relatively small number of privacy groups,” Farid said, speaking to the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) on the child safety group’s latest podcast. “I contend that the vast majority of people would have said ‘sure, this seems perfectly reasonable’, but yet a relatively small but vocal group put a huge amount of pressure on Apple and I think Apple, somewhat cowardly, succumbed to that pressure. “I think they should have stuck their ground and said: ‘This is the right thing to do and we are going to do it.’ And I am a strong advocate of not just Apple doing this, but Snap doing this, and Google doing this – all the online services doing this.” Apple first announced its plans to carry out “client-side scanning” in August 2021, alongside other child-safety proposals that have since arrived on iPhones. The company intended to update iPhones with software that would let them match child abuse images stored in a user’s photo library with identical copies already known to authorities from being shared on the web, and flag those users to child protection agencies. After an outcry from privacy groups, the company shelved the proposal in September that year, and has not discussed it publicly since. But in July, the leads of the UK’s security services published a paper detailing their belief that such scanning could be deployed in a way that assuaged some fears, such as the concern that an oppressive nation could hijack the scanning to search for politically contentious imagery. “Details matter when talking about this subject,” Ian Levy and Crispin Robinson wrote. “Discussing the subject in generalities, using ambiguous language or hyperbole, will almost certainly lead to the wrong outcome.” Farid argued that the time is ripe for Apple and other technology companies to act and get ahead of legislation. “With the online safety bill making its way through the UK government, and with the DSA [Digital Services Act] and the DMA [Digital Markets Act] making its way through Brussels, I believe this is now the time for the companies to say: ‘We are going to do this, we’re going to do it on our terms.’ And, if they don’t, then I think we have to step in with a very heavy hand and insist they do. “We routinely scan on our devices, on our email, on our cloud services for everything including spam and malware and viruses and ransomware, and we do that willingly because it protects us. I don’t think it is hyperbolic to say that, if we are willing to protect ourselves, then we should be willing to protect the most vulnerable among us. “It is the same basic core technology, and I reject those that say this is somehow giving something up. I would argue this is, in fact, exactly the balance that we should have in order to protect children online and protect our privacy and our rights.” Speaking about the Levy/Robinson paper, Mike Tunks, head of policy and public affairs at the IWF, said: “For the last few years, the government has been saying: ‘We want tech companies to do more about tackling child sexual abuse in end-to-end encrypted environments.’ “As we know, at the minute, there is no technology that can do that, but this paper sets out some ways in which that can be achieved.”","He said that, following an intervention from the technical leads of GCHQ and the National Cyber Security Centre backing an extension of the technology on to individual phones, Apple should be emboldened to revive its shelved plans to do just that. “I think they should have stuck their ground and said: ‘This is the right thing to do and we are going to do it.’ And I am a strong advocate of not just Apple doing this, but Snap doing this, and Google doing this – all the online services doing this.” Apple first announced its plans to carry out “client-side scanning” in August 2021, alongside other child-safety proposals that have since arrived on iPhones. “With the online safety bill making its way through the UK government, and with the DSA [Digital Services Act] and the DMA [Digital Markets Act] making its way through Brussels, I believe this is now the time for the companies to say: ‘We are going to do this, we’re going to do it on our terms.’ And, if they don’t, then I think we have to step in with a very heavy hand and insist they do.

146,146,"For years Craig Wright has claimed that he is the mythical figure who created bitcoin. But a legal bid by the Australian computer scientist to defend his assertion that he is Satoshi Nakamoto resulted in a pyrrhic victory and a tarnished reputation on Monday. A high court judge in London ruled Wright had given “deliberately false evidence” in a libel case and awarded him £1 in damages after he sued a blogger for alleging that his claim to be the elusive Nakamoto was fraudulent. “Because he [Wright] advanced a deliberately false case and put forward deliberately false evidence until days before trial, he will recover only nominal damages,” wrote Justice Chamberlain. Wright had sued blogger Peter McCormack over a series of tweets in 2019, and a video discussion broadcast on YouTube, in which McCormack said Wright was a “fraud” and is not Satoshi. The issue of Nakamoto’s identity was not covered by the judge’s ruling because McCormack had earlier abandoned a defence of truth in his case. Wright claimed that his reputation within the cryptocurrency industry had been “seriously harmed” by McCormack’s claims. He said he had been invited to speak at numerous conferences after the successful submission of academic papers for blind peer review, but 10 invites had been withdrawn following McCormack’s tweets. This included alleged potential appearances at events in France, Vietnam, the US, Canada and Portugal. But McCormack submitted evidence from academics challenging Wright’s claims, which were then dropped from his case at the trial in May. Wright later accepted that some of his evidence was “wrong” but said that this was “inadvertent”, Chamberlain said in his judgment. The judge noted that there was “no documentary evidence” that Wright had a paper accepted at any of the conferences identified in the earlier version of his libel claim, nor that he received an invitation to speak at them except possibly at one, and that any invitation was withdrawn. Wright’s explanation for abandoning this part of his case because the alleged damage to his reputation from the “disinvitations” was outside England and Wales “does not withstand scrutiny”, the judge added. He concluded: “Dr Wright’s original case on serious harm, and the evidence supporting it, both of which were maintained until days before trial, were deliberately false.” Lawyers for McCormack had argued that his tweets were made in “flippant and lighthearted terms” and were in response to posts by Calvin Ayre, a Canadian businessman, “goading others into accusing Dr Wright of being a fraud”. They also claimed there were “numerous other individuals who had posted the same allegations about Wright”, Chamberlain explained in his ruling. Chamberlain concluded that although the tweets were “flippant in tone”, they came from “a well-known podcaster and acknowledged expert in cryptocurrency”. “They were unequivocal in their meaning. Many people who read them would have known that there was a lively debate about whether Dr Wright was Satoshi, but some of them must have been influenced by reading Mr McCormack’s trenchantly expressed contribution to that debate,” the judge continued. “The fact that he was willing to state his views so brazenly in response to threats of libel proceedings is likely to have made those who read them more, not less, likely to believe them.” But the judge said that Wright’s pre-trial case over the serious harm to his reputation made it “unconscionable” that he should receive “any more than nominal damages”. The judge asked for both sides’ legal teams to make submissions on the award of costs. Chamberlain found that McCormack’s comments in the video discussion, which included calling Wright a “liar” and a “moron” were defamatory, while the video and a majority of the tweets caused “serious harm” to Wright’s reputation. In statement Wright said: “I intend to appeal the adverse findings of the judgment in which my evidence was clearly misunderstood. I will continue legal challenges until these baseless and harmful attacks designed to belittle my reputation stop.”","The judge noted that there was “no documentary evidence” that Wright had a paper accepted at any of the conferences identified in the earlier version of his libel claim, nor that he received an invitation to speak at them except possibly at one, and that any invitation was withdrawn.

147,147,"The father of Elon Musk said during an interview that he isn’t proud of his billionaire son, saying that Elon is unhappy with his own career progress. During the strange interview Monday with the Australia radio The Kyle and Jackie O Show, 76-year-old Errol Musk was asked if he was proud of Elon’s accomplishments. Errol replied: “No. You know, we are a family that have been doing a lot of things for a long time, it’s not as if we suddenly started doing something.” The interview didn’t just provide the elder Musk a chance to punch down on his child. In addition to discussing Elon, Errol’s interview also touched upon recent news that he fathered two children with his stepdaughter, 35-year-old Jana Bezuidenhout. Errol, who is 42 years older than Bezuidenhout, became her stepfather when she was four years old. He called his relationship with her “completely normal”. Those remarks echoed other earlier ones in which he claimed: “The only thing we are on Earth for is to reproduce.” “I can’t see any reason not to.” Errol in the interview Monday conceded that Elon, the founder of Tesla and the chief of SpaceX, has accomplished quite a bit in comparison with his siblings. “They’ve seen a lot of things, and we’ve done a lot of things together,” said Errol of his family, referring to his clan’s travels to China, the Amazon rainforest, and other places. “But Elon has in fact sort of really surpassed the mark.” Errol continued discussing his son, saying that the younger Musk feels “behind schedule” in terms of where he wants his various companies to be, and is “not as happy as he’d like to be”. “He is frustrated with progress and it’s understandable,” said Errol. “I know it sounds crazy, but we tend to think like that as a family. He’s 50 now and I still think of him as a little boy. But he’s 50, I mean that’s an old man.” Compared with Elon, Errol said during the interview that his other son, Kimbal Musk, is the “pride and joy” of his life. Kimbal is a restaurateur and chef with an estimated net worth of $700m, though Errol claimed that Kimbal was also a billionaire, reported Business Insider. Errol’s interview Monday came just days after his son decided to file a countersuit against Twitter, which escalated his legal fight against the social media giant over his attempts to walk away from a $44bn purchase agreement.","Those remarks echoed other earlier ones in which he claimed: “The only thing we are on Earth for is to reproduce.” “I can’t see any reason not to.” Errol in the interview Monday conceded that Elon, the founder of Tesla and the chief of SpaceX, has accomplished quite a bit in comparison with his siblings. “They’ve seen a lot of things, and we’ve done a lot of things together,” said Errol of his family, referring to his clan’s travels to China, the Amazon rainforest, and other places. “But Elon has in fact sort of really surpassed the mark.” Errol continued discussing his son, saying that the younger Musk feels “behind schedule” in terms of where he wants his various companies to be, and is “not as happy as he’d like to be”.

148,148,"The head of Instagram is temporarily relocating to London less than a week after the Meta-owned company faced outrage from influencers such as Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner over changes to the popular photo-sharing app. Adam Mosseri, who has a strong relationship with the billionaire Meta owner Mark Zuckerberg, will move to the company’s offices in King’s Cross amid the tech firm’s battle for users with its Chinese rival TikTok. A Meta spokesperson told the Guardian: “Given the global nature of his role, Adam will be temporarily based out of London later this year. “London is already Meta’s largest engineering hub outside of the US, with over 4,000 employees across our offices, including a dedicated Instagram product team with people focused on building long term solutions for creators.” The 39-year-old will reportedly be seeking to hire more staff in the capital’s product team because it is cheaper to recruit tech professionals in London than in San Francisco, where the company has its headquarters. Instagram could also take advantage of changes to research and development tax credits that offer incentives for innovation, according to reports first appearing in the Financial Times. News of Mosseri’s move across the pond comes after the fierce rivalry between Instagram and TikTok hit the headlines last week after the Meta-owned company made changes to the photo-sharing app sparking criticism it was “mimicking” the Chinese social media firm. Instagram trialled the new features, such as recommended video content, on Thursday but was forced into a screeching U-turn after comments from unhappy users. To make matters worse, influencer royalty Kardashian and her sister, Jenner shared an online petition to their stories to “Make Instagram Instagram again” and urged “stop trying to be TikTok”. In an interview responding to the criticism, Mosseri told the tech newsletter Platformer: “I’m glad we took a risk – if we’re not failing every once in a while, we’re not thinking big enough or bold enough. “But we definitely need to take a big step back and regroup. [When] we’ve learned a lot, then we come back with some sort of new idea or iteration. So we’re going to work through that.” It comes as Meta, who also own WhatsApp and Facebook, reported its first ever decline in revenue last week due to a weak advertising market.","The head of Instagram is temporarily relocating to London less than a week after the Meta-owned company faced outrage from influencers such as Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner over changes to the popular photo-sharing app. Adam Mosseri, who has a strong relationship with the billionaire Meta owner Mark Zuckerberg, will move to the company’s offices in King’s Cross amid the tech firm’s battle for users with its Chinese rival TikTok. “London is already Meta’s largest engineering hub outside of the US, with over 4,000 employees across our offices, including a dedicated Instagram product team with people focused on building long term solutions for creators.” The 39-year-old will reportedly be seeking to hire more staff in the capital’s product team because it is cheaper to recruit tech professionals in London than in San Francisco, where the company has its headquarters.

Passengers took a total of 1.87bn trips on Uber during the spring and early summer, the company reported on Tuesday, a 24% increase compared with the same time last year. That’s about 21m trips a day, on average. Wall Street overlooked a huge loss for the quarter and shares jumped more than 12% before the opening bell on Tuesday. Revenue at the San Francisco company more than doubled to $8.07bn, bolstered by a change in the business model for its UK mobility business and the acquisition of Transplace by Uber Freight. This beat the $7.36bn that analysts polled by FactSet predicted. Gross bookings surged 33% to $29.08bn, an all-time high and Uber Technologies foresees third-quarter gross bookings between $29bn and $30bn. Uber lost $2.6bn for the three months ending 30 June. This included a $1.7bn related to Uber’s equity investments and $470m in stock-based compensation expense. Uber has regained a lot of ground since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020 triggered government lockdowns that kept most people at home. The company pivoted at the time by building up a then-nascent food-delivery division, although that segment isn’t growing as rapidly as last year with so many people returning to restaurants. The company, like many others, has struggled to find drivers since the pandemic hit. But that shortage appears to be easing. “We saw an acceleration in both active and new driver growth in the quarter,” its chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said.

150,150,"Nearly $6m (£4.9m) has been drained from accounts linked to the Solana crypto network after a hacker targeted 8,000 wallets. The Solana Foundation, an organisation that supports the blockchain network, said a “malicious actor” had taken funds from a number of wallets linked to Solana. It said the hack had affected approximately 8,000 wallets, the virtual equivalent of physical wallets where users store their cryptocurrency and the private keys that give them unique ownership of their assets. “Engineers are currently working with multiple security researchers and ecosystem teams to identify the root cause of the exploit, which is unknown at this time,” said the foundation, via the Solana Status Twitter account. Elliptic, a blockchain consultancy that helps clients combat crypto-related crime, said the attack began on 2 August and $5.8m had been taken so far. It said the assets stolen included the Solana cryptocurrency, or SOL, and non-fungible tokens. “Users of the Solana blockchain have become the latest target for crypto hackers,” said Elliptic. “The attack – which began on August 2 – has so far seen over $5.8m in funds drained from 7,947 wallets. The stolen assets include SOL, a small number of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and over 300 Solana-based tokens.” Elliptic added that the problem appeared to be with software used by certain wallets rather than the blockchain itself, the digital register recording transactions that forms the basis of crypto assets. “The root cause is still not clear, but it appears to be due to a flaw in certain wallet software – rather than in the Solana blockchain itself,” said Elliptic, adding that it appeared a single hacker was involved.","It said the hack had affected approximately 8,000 wallets, the virtual equivalent of physical wallets where users store their cryptocurrency and the private keys that give them unique ownership of their assets. “Engineers are currently working with multiple security researchers and ecosystem teams to identify the root cause of the exploit, which is unknown at this time,” said the foundation, via the Solana Status Twitter account.

151,151,"I’ve been writing about cryptocurrency for my entire career. In that time, one point I’ve always stuck to is simple: don’t listen to me for investment advice. Today, I want to quantify why. Bitcoin was created in 2009, while I was in my first year at university. As an economics student – and massive nerd – it sat squarely at the intersection of my interests. By my final year of uni in 2011, the original cryptocurrency was experiencing its first boom and bust cycle. It rose from a low of $0.30 to a high of $32.34 that summer, before crashing back down to less than $3 when Mt. Gox, the original bitcoin exchange, was hacked. (This will become a theme.) That was also the year the Guardian first covered the currency, with Ruth Whippman warning: “Its critics in the political sphere fear that it could give rise to an online Wild West of gambling, prostitution and global bazaars for contraband.” I was very much on the outside looking in, though. Not being a regular drug user (cf “massive nerd”), the mainstream use of bitcoin – getting pills or weed delivered by post from the Silk Road – passed me by, so I found it more of an intellectual curiosity than anything else. This is perhaps in part because the first thing I remember hearing about bitcoin was a tale, probably apocryphal, of someone using their gaming PC to mine the currency in their dorm room in a heatwave. The air conditioning failed, the user reported in a forum post, and heatstroke left them with mild brain damage. You can see why I was unimpressed. By the second major boom, I was covering economics for the New Statesman. And that’s where the trouble starts. In my first published piece using the word “bitcoin” – the first time the New Statesman had covered the topic – I confidently declared: “This is what a bubble looks like.” At the time, bitcoin was trading at around $40 a coin. It has never gotten that low again. I was right that there was a bubble in the offing: the price of bitcoin had doubled in two months, and would double twice more before it popped less than a month later. But the crash, which would have been huge for any other normal asset, was a reduction of around half, taking bitcoin to the lows of … three weeks prior. A decade on, the memory of this bold claim still haunts me, and I refuse to make predictions about the future of any cryptocurrency. In fact, I’ve taken to joking that the best way to make money, historically, is to do the opposite of what I say. So I put it to the test. The Alex Hern bitcoin investment strategy Obviously, I don’t give actual investment advice. So I reviewed every article I’ve ever written that mentions “bitcoin”, and sorted them based on whether or not a reader would think they were good news for the crypto, or bad news. There’s an element of value judgment to this, of course: you might disagree with my decision that a story about the Winklevii launching a bitcoin price tracker in 2014 is broadly positive; or that a story about Mt. Gox reopening after a hack (another hack) is broadly negative. My hope is that the disagreements average out. Then, I paired the stories against the price of bitcoin on the day they were written, and asked a simple question: if you’d bought $10 of bitcoin every time I wrote something that seemed like bad news, and sold $10 of bitcoin every time I wrote something that seemed like good news, how would your investment have performed? The bottom line: you would have spent a net of $420 on bitcoin, and have a crypto wallet containing around 1.1 bitcoin as a result – worth, at today’s market value, a little over $22,000. Oof. Going over the specifics, though, gives me a bit of cheer. Well over half that gain comes from a total of just seven pieces written in 2013: six negative and one positive. At the end of that run, you’d have spent $50, and own 0.7 bitcoin. Those articles have an outsized influence on the over-calculation, due to how much bitcoin’s value has increased in the nine years since they were published. Bitcoin had two boom and bust cycles in 2013. The first, in April, took it to a high of $266. The second, in December was bigger – much bigger. The price of a coin spiked at $1,238, and fell to a low of $687. The rush of pieces I wrote about the currency when I started at the Guardian, through late 2013 and the first half of 2014, contribute much less to the bottom line, even though there were more of them. It was also the period with the most positive stories for bitcoin. In 2014, the potential of the currency was still untapped: the idea that bitcoin or the blockchain might prove revolutionary wasn’t a hackneyed promise, but something that might be just around the corner. In that boom, I wrote as many positive stories as negative. For every article about bitcoin hitting an “all-time high” of $269, there was another about a £1m hack of a payment processor. For every long feature asking if bitcoin was about to change the world, there was a warning from a Dutch central banker that the hype was “worse than tulip mania” (and he should know). The timing of the pieces didn’t quite balance out, though, and by the end of that boom you would have turned your 0.7 bitcoin into 0.9 while cashing out as many dollars as you put in. And in that period, those bitcoin would have gone from $100 to more than $500. From 2014 to the most recent boom, however, the money you put in would start being drowned out by the bitcoin you already own. $10 at the beginning of 2014 bought you around 0.01 bitcoin, and so 10 negative pieces from me would have sizeably increased your position. Three years later, it would take 30 negative pieces for you to acquire the same amount of bitcoin. That meant the impact of the ICO boom – the first of the great expansions of the sector from a handful of cryptocurrencies to a whole ecosystem of shitcoins – was muted compared to what came before, despite stories about Iceland becoming a miner’s paradise and Kodak bringing out a branded cryptominer, leading to a flurry of buying and selling. And three years after that, at the beginning of 2020, a $10 investment in the cryptocurrency would get you just 0.001 BTC. That’s good news for our theoretical investor, because 2020 marked my most positive reporting on the currency. Stories such as the US government seizing bitcoins used in the Silk Road were a sign of the growing professionalism of the sector and, for the first time, bitcoin was enough of a fixture of the tech scene that even in a comparative slump the Guardian was still covering it. On to the latest boom and bust cycle, where – finally – the investor starts to lose out and I claw back some of my reputation. From its peak at $69,000 earlier this year, bitcoin has fallen by a third. I’ve diligently covered the collapse, which has been by far the most brutal the sector has faced. That means the tracker has sunk almost $200 into bitcoin, and even as the overall value of the holdings has plummeted from a high of $50,000 in March to its present number. What next? The question going forward, of course, is whether the pattern holds up. Will you continue to make money if you buy when I’m grumpy about crypto, and sell when I’m optimistic? Obviously – see above – I’m not about to make any strong predictions, but I doubt we’ll ever again see as sharp an increase in price as we saw in the last decade, which means I’ll never make a call that plays out as badly as the ones in those initial pieces from 2013. Which is not to say I can’t make other terrible calls. Remember Dejitaru Tsuka, the shitcoin that was sold with my name? I broke my rules, and warned readers: “I do not think you should buy this shitcoin, nor any others.” Well, if you’d bought £10 worth of Tsuka when I said that, you’d now have … £4,000.

The acquisition, announced on Friday, is part of Amazon’s bid to own part of the home space through services and accelerate its growth beyond retail, said Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData Retail. The appliance would join the voice assistant Alexa, the Astro robot and Ring security cameras and others in the list of smart home features offered by the Seattle-based e-commerce and tech giant. So far, Amazon has not had much success with household robots. The company’s Astro robot, which helps with tasks like setting an alarm, was unveiled last year at an introductory price of $1,000. But its rollout has been limited and has received a lackluster response. The iRobot acquisition, however, and the company’s strong market reputation provide a “massive foothold in the consumer robot market” that could help Amazon replicate the success of its Echo line of smart speakers, said Lian Jye Su, a robotics industry analyst for ABI Research. Su said it also illustrates the shortcomings of consumer robotics vendors like iRobot, which struggled to expand beyond a niche product and was in a “race-to-the-bottom” competition with Korean and Chinese manufacturers offering cheaper versions of a robotic vacuum. iRobot’s quarterly results, which were released on Friday, showed revenue plunged 30% primarily on order reductions and delays. The company also announced it was laying off 10% of its workforce. Amazon said it will acquire iRobot for $61 per share in an all-cash transaction that will include iRobot’s net debt. The company has total current debt of approximately $332.1m as of 2 July. The deal is subject to approval by shareholders and regulators. Upon completion, iRobot’s CEO, Colin Angle, will remain in his position. Noting that iRobot has been running its robotics platform on Amazon’s cloud service unit AWS for many years, Su said the acquisition could lead to more integration of Amazon speech recognition and other capabilities into vacuums. The iRobot deal comes as anti-monopoly advocates continue to raise concerns about Amazon’s increasing dominance. The purchase is Amazon’s fourth-largest acquisition, led by its $13.7bn deal to buy Whole Foods in 2017. Last month, the company said it would buy the primary care provider One Medical in a deal valued at roughly $3.9bn, a move that expanded its reach further into healthcare. On Friday, groups advocating for stricter antitrust regulations called on regulators to block the iRobot merger, arguing it gives Amazon more access into consumers’ lives and furthers its dominance in the smart home market. The Roomba device, for example, allows users to map out the entirety of their homes room by room and store the maps in the iRobot app for future use. Consumers can then remotely schedule regular cleanings or manually start cleaning jobs of specific rooms directly from the app. “The last thing American and the world needs is Amazon vacuuming up even more of our personal information,” said Robert Weissman, president of the progressive consumer rights advocacy group Public Citizen. “This is not just about Amazon selling another device in its marketplace,“ Weissman said. “It’s about the company gaining still more intimate details of our lives to gain unfair market advantage and sell us more stuff.” Landmark antitrust legislation targeting Amazon and other big tech companies has languished for months in Congress as prospects for votes by the full Senate or House have dimmed. Last month, Amy Klobuchar, the senator from Minnesota who heads the Senate judiciary antitrust panel, urged the the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the One Medical acquisition, in the mold of other critics who have called on regulators to block the purchase over concerns about Amazon’s past conduct and potential implications for consumers’ health data. Regulators also have discretion to challenge Amazon’s $8.5bn buyout of Hollywood studio MGM, which was completed earlier this year. Founded in 1990 by a trio of Massachusetts Institute of Technology roboticists, including Angle, iRobot’s early ventures led to rovers that could perform military and disaster-relief tasks in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.","The appliance would join the voice assistant Alexa, the Astro robot and Ring security cameras and others in the list of smart home features offered by the Seattle-based e-commerce and tech giant.

153,153,"Elon Musk has accused Twitter of deliberately miscounting the number of spam accounts on its platform as part of a “scheme” to mislead investors. The Tesla chief executive made the allegations in a countersuit against the social media company, which is taking Musk to court in an attempt to make him complete an agreed $44bn (£36.5bn) takeover of the business. Musk repeats a claim that Twitter miscounts the amount of false and spam users on its platform as part of a “scheme to mislead investors about the company’s prospects”, according to the suit, which was unsealed on Friday. Valid user numbers are a key metric for Twitter, which makes 90% of its revenue from advertisers. The suit says Twitter’s disclosures to the US financial watchdog are inaccurate and have distorted the value of a company that Musk has agreed to buy for $54.20 a share. It says filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contain “numerous, material misrepresentations or omissions that distort Twitter’s value and caused the Musk Parties to agree to acquire the company at an inflated price”. Referring to Twitter’s suit demanding Musk buy the company, it adds: “Twitter’s Complaint, filled with personal attacks against Musk and gaudy rhetoric more directed at a media audience than this Court, is nothing more than an attempt to distract from these misrepresentations.” Twitter has consistently stated that spam accounts represent less than 5% of its user base, which currently stands at just under 238 million. Musk claims that Twitter has overstated the number of monetisable daily active users on the platform, or users who see ads. The number of users that see ads is 65 million lower, the lawsuit claims. Spam accounts are automated, meaning they are not operated by a human hand, and are designed to manipulate users or disrupt their interactions on the platform. Musk argues that the misrepresentations represent a “company material adverse effect” that substantially alters Twitter’s value and therefore invalidate the deal agreement. Musk pulled out of the Twitter deal in July, citing concerns about spam accounts. Twitter’s response to the Musk countersuit was published on Thursday. In it, Twitter called Musk’s arguments for abandoning the deal “a story, imagined in an effort to escape a merger agreement that Musk no longer found attractive once the stock market and along with it, his massive personal wealth, declined in value”. “The counterclaims are a made-for-litigation tale that is contradicted by the evidence and common sense,” the response says. Twitter’s lawsuit to force Musk to buy the company is due to start in Delaware on 17 October. Robert Frenchman, a partner at New York law firm Mukasey Frenchman, said he does not believe Musk’s claims will prevail ultimately, having agreed to buy the company with a minimal amount of due diligence, but his legal claims are damaging the company. “Whether or not Musk’s claim is meritorious, and I don’t think it is, it has made things extraordinarily difficult for Twitter. Twitter finds itself in a kind of legal limbo, while the litigation continues and trial awaits. It’s a huge distraction for the company. It puts the company’s strategy and direction into hiatus,” said Frenchman, who added that Twitter is making life “more difficult” for Musk by issuing subpoenas on the Tesla CEO’s associates and banks.","The Tesla chief executive made the allegations in a countersuit against the social media company, which is taking Musk to court in an attempt to make him complete an agreed $44bn (£36.5bn) takeover of the business.

154,154,"Apple has reportedly asked Taiwan-based suppliers to label their products as being produced in China, in an effort to avoid disruption from strict Chinese customs inspections resulting from the visit of the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to Taipei. According to Nikkei, the company has asked manufacturers on the island to label components bound for mainland China as made in “Chinese Taipei” or “Taiwan, China”. The labels are required in order to comply with a longstanding but previously unenforced rule that requires imported goods to suggest the island is part of the People’s Republic of China. The phrase “Made in Taiwan” can lead to delays, fines, and even the rejection of an entire shipment under the rule. But Taiwan itself requires exports to be labelled with the point of origin: either the name “Taiwan” or the country’s official name, “Republic of China”. The choice to require suppliers to deny Taiwan’s independent existence has led to criticism from around the world. GreatFire, which works against Chinese censorship online, noted that the move was an escalation from a previous slight by Apple, which removed the Taiwan flag from emoji keyboards for users in China and Hong Kong. “Is it a question of time before Apple starts removing apps whose name contains the characters [for] Taiwan without specifying ‘province of China’,” the organisation asked. “Unfortunately, we suspect that Apple’s ‘red-line’, the moment where it will say: ‘Stop, no longer, we cannot continue to collaborate with the Chinese regime and enforce its requests for censorship,’ is nowhere close,” GreatFire’s Benjamin Ismail told the Register news site. Apple may have felt as if it had little choice but to comply with China’s requests. Shipment delays now would be ruinous, as the company moves into the final production phase for the iPhone 14, expected to be announced at a press event next month. Supply chain shortages have already started to bite, with the company taking the unprecedented decision, according to influential analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, of shipping the cheaper non-Pro variants of the phone with the same core chip that is already in the iPhones 13 currently on sale. Apple’s long-running attempts to diversify its production process are finally paying off, however. According to Kuo, the company expects to ship versions of the iPhone 14 from factories in India alongside its Chinese manufacturers on release day. In previous years, Indian factories have been months behind China on the cutting-edge devices, waiting for early kinks to be smoothed out before they switch production over from older models. This year, for instance, Foxconn’s Indian sites began assembling the iPhone 13 in April, around the same time that the company’s Brazilian operations switched over. The models produced in India and Brazil largely serve to fulfil demand in local markets, and aren’t intended to be exported around the world. For that, Apple’s Chinese factories still serve an irreplaceable role, as they do in serving the millions of Chinese customers who buy iPhones.","Apple has reportedly asked Taiwan-based suppliers to label their products as being produced in China, in an effort to avoid disruption from strict Chinese customs inspections resulting from the visit of the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to Taipei.

155,155,"A ransomware attack on a software supplier has hit the NHS across the UK and there are fears that patient data may have been the target. Advanced, the UK company hit by the attack last week, said it was working with government agencies, including the National Cyber Security Centre and the Information Commissioner’s Office, in the aftermath of the incident. Details such as the identity of the attacker(s) and the scale of the damage have yet to emerge, but here is a guide to what we know so far and how ransomware gangs operate. What is a ransomware attack? This is when a group gains access to an entity’s computer system, sometimes via an email “phishing” attack. They have also involved entering a virtual private network (VPN) that is used by employees to access their employer’s internal computer systems when, for example, they are working from home. Once inside, rogue actors deploy a piece of malware – malicious software – that encrypts computers, making it impossible to access their content. The bad actor then demands money in exchange for decrypting or unlocking the computers. While data is not always taken during attacks, if it is it can be used as part of the negotiations. Ransomware gangs have created websites where stolen data is displayed. How severe was the attack? The attack on the morning of 4 August caused widespread outages across the NHS. The target was Advanced, a company that provides software for various parts of the health service. It affected services including patient referrals, ambulance dispatch, out-of-hours appointment bookings, mental health services and emergency prescriptions. The impact can be worked out by looking at which Advanced systems were directly or indirectly hit. They included Adastra, which helps 111 call handlers dispatch ambulances and helps doctors access a patient’s GP records; Carenotes, which is used by mental health trusts for patient records; Caresys, which is used in care homes; Crosscare, which helps run hospices; and Staffplan, used by care organisations. The Health Service Journal has reported that at least nine NHS mental health trusts have been affected by the outage, reducing their access to patients’ records. Advanced software is used in 36 acute trusts or mental health trusts in England, according to Digital Health Intelligence. A leaked internal NHS England document seen by the Guardian has disclosed that “a number of NHS services, including NHS 111, some urgent treatment centres and some mental health providers use software that have been taken offline”. In an email to staff reported by the Independent, the Oxford Health NHS foundation trust’s chief executive, Dr Nick Broughton, said: “The cyber-attack targeted systems used to refer patients for care, including ambulances being dispatched, out-of-hours appointment bookings, triage, out-of-hours care, emergency prescriptions and safety alerts. It also targeted the finance system used by the trust. “We have now been advised that we should prepare for a system outage that could continue for two weeks for Adastra and possibly longer than three weeks for Carenotes.” Advanced hinted in a statement late on Wednesday that a full recovery for some services could take weeks. Apart from work to get 111 back on track, contingency plans would have to be in place “for at least three to four more weeks”, it said. NHS England said some 111 callers may face longer waits than usual. Who might be behind the attack? No group has been named as the attacker, but it has been reported that it is likely to be a criminal gang rather than a state organisation. The most notorious ransomware group in recent times is the one behind attacks using the Conti malware, which hobbled the Irish healthcare system last year and the Costa Rican government earlier this year. This Russian-linked criminal group appears to have wound down its Conti malware attacks. However, there has been widespread speculation that the same group is behind a new piece of malware called Black Basta. There is no evidence that the Conti/Black Basta group is behind the NHS attack and there are many other potential candidates. There are a variety of ransomware groups out there, with different malware (the names of the malware and the groups behind them are often viewed as interchangeable). Names of malware operations that have been linked to healthcare attacks over the past year include BlackCat, Quantum, Hive and AvosLocker. Are healthcare organisations a popular target? There had been signs of a hiatus in attacks on health organisations during the pandemic, with the ransomware group Maze saying it would not hit medical targets. But even before the Advanced attack it seemed the situation was changing. For instance, the Irish healthcare system attack was in May 2021. The number of health organisations around the world targeted by cyber-attacks rose 90% in the three months to 30 June compared with the first three months of 2022, according to the risk consultancy Kroll. This study was based on the 3,200 incidents across all sectors reported to the consultancy over the past 12 months. Ioan Peters, the managing director of cyber risk at Kroll, said: “This latest cyber-attack and possible data extraction impacting the NHS comes as healthcare organisations across the world are facing increased pressure from cybercriminals.” He said the study showed healthcare was the most targeted sector and that “we’ve definitely reached the end of the truce that some criminal groups instituted earlier in the Covid pandemic”. In the healthcare ransomware cases Kroll had seen, there was a “double extortion” tactic in which data was taken before the victim’s network was encrypted, and then the hackers threatened to leak the data in an attempt to gain leverage during negotiations.","Advanced, the UK company hit by the attack last week, said it was working with government agencies, including the National Cyber Security Centre and the Information Commissioner’s Office, in the aftermath of the incident.

156,156,"Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, has been rewriting websites its users visit, letting the company follow them across the web after they click links in its apps, according to new research from an ex-Google engineer. The two apps have been taking advantage of the fact that users who click on links are taken to webpages in an “in-app browser”, controlled by Facebook or Instagram, rather than sent to the user’s web browser of choice, such as Safari or Firefox. “The Instagram app injects their tracking code into every website shown, including when clicking on ads, enabling them [to] monitor all user interactions, like every button and link tapped, text selections, screenshots, as well as any form inputs, like passwords, addresses and credit card numbers,” says Felix Krause, a privacy researcher who founded an app development tool acquired by Google in 2017. In a statement, Meta said that injecting a tracking code obeyed users’ preferences on whether or not they allowed apps to follow them, and that it was only used to aggregate data before being applied for targeted advertising or measurement purposes for those users who opted out of such tracking. “We intentionally developed this code to honour people’s [Ask to track] choices on our platforms,” a spokesperson said. “The code allows us to aggregate user data before using it for targeted advertising or measurement purposes. We do not add any pixels. Code is injected so that we can aggregate conversion events from pixels.” They added: “For purchases made through the in-app browser, we seek user consent to save payment information for the purposes of autofill.” Krause discovered the code injection by building a tool that could list all the extra commands added to a website by the browser. For normal browsers, and most apps, the tool detects no changes, but for Facebook and Instagram it finds up to 18 lines of code added by the app. Those lines of code appear to scan for a particular cross-platform tracking kit and, if not installed, instead call the Meta Pixel, a tracking tool that allows the company to follow a user around the web and offer targeted advertising based on their browsing. The company does not disclose to the user that it is rewriting webpages in this way. No such code is added to the in-app browser of WhatsApp, according to Krause’s research. “Javascript injection” – the practice of adding extra code to a webpage before it is displayed to a user – is frequently classified as a type of malicious attack. Cybersecurity company Feroot, for instance, describes it as an attack that “allows the threat actor to manipulate the website or web application and collect sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII) or payment information.” There is no suggestion that Meta has used its Javascript injection to collect such sensitive data. In the company’s description of the Meta Pixel, which is usually voluntarily added to websites to help companies advertise to users on Instagram and Facebook, it says the tool “allows you to track visitor activity on your website” and that it can collect associated data. It is unclear when Facebook began injecting code to track users after clicking links. In recent years, the company has had a noisy public standoff with Apple, after the latter introduced a requirement for app developers to ask permission to track users across apps. After the prompt was launched, many Facebook advertisers found themselves unable to target users on the social network, ultimately leading to $10bn of lost revenue and a 26% fall in the company’s share price earlier this year, according to Meta. • This article was amended on 14 August 2022. An earlier version said that Meta Pixel allowed Meta to “build an accurate profile of their interests”. It has been clarified to report that the tool enables the company to send targeted advertising to users; Meta has said the pixel is not used to build a profile of interests.","Code is injected so that we can aggregate conversion events from pixels.” They added: “For purchases made through the in-app browser, we seek user consent to save payment information for the purposes of autofill.” Krause discovered the code injection by building a tool that could list all the extra commands added to a website by the browser.

157,157,"Google will stop giving snappy answers to stupid questions, the company has announced, as it seeks to improve its search engine’s “featured snippets” service. That means users should see fewer answers to questions such as “When did Snoopy assassinate Abraham Lincoln?”, to which the service would once merrily respond with “1865” – the right date, but very much the wrong assassin. “This clearly isn’t the most helpful way to display this result,” said the company’s head of search, Pandu Nayak, in a blogpost announcing the changes. “We’ve trained our systems to get better at detecting these sorts of false premises, which are not very common, but there are cases where it’s not helpful to show a featured snippet. We’ve reduced the triggering of featured snippets in these cases by 40% with this update.” Snippets, which sometimes show up as a featured response to direct questions asked of Google Search, have long been a cornerstone of the company’s AI strategy. The same technology powers its smart speakers and voice assistants, and lets the search engine satisfy search queries without visitors clicking away to other websites. But the snippets, which are automatically generated from the contents of websites, have also been a thorn in Google’s side for just as long. In 2017, the company was accused of spreading “fake news” after a featured snippet for the query “Is Obama planning a coup?”, resulted in its voice assistant cheerily telling users: “Obama may in fact be planning a communist coup d’état at the end of his term in 2016,” after it found the information on a conspiracy website. Other errors have been more comical. The company would gamely tell users that stairs were invented in 1946 – after reading a website that attributed a particular US safety regulation to that date – or unknowingly repeat a Monty Python joke when asked: “Why are firetrucks red?” In an effort to address the root cause of such mistakes, Google is also rolling out new warnings for times when a search term has hit a “data void” – a question where a good answer might simply not exist. “It looks like there aren’t many great results for this search,” the site now warns users who hit such a query. “This doesn’t mean that no helpful information is available, or that a particular result is low-quality,” Nayak says. “These notices provide context about the whole set of results on the page, and you can always see the results for your query, even when the advisory is present.”","“This clearly isn’t the most helpful way to display this result,” said the company’s head of search, Pandu Nayak, in a blogpost announcing the changes.

158,158,"The billionaire Peter Thiel’s plans for an elaborate bunker-like lodge in a remote part of New Zealand’s South Island have been thwarted, after the local council decided the home would have too great a negative impact on the surrounding landscape. Second Star, a New Zealand company owned by the PayPal co-founder, had applied to build the sprawling lakeside complex in Wanaka, an alpine South Island region known for its natural beauty and isolation. The plans were fiercely opposed by conservationists, who claimed in submissions that the lodge would “destroy our beautiful lake environment”. On Thursday, Queenstown-Lakes district council refused to grant consent for the lodge to be built. Thiel – an outspoken libertarian and early Facebook investor – is one of a number of super-rich speculators who began buying up remote boltholes in New Zealand, in preparation for apocalyptic social, political or environmental disintegration. He had previously discussed flying out to the country as a backup plan in the event of a pandemic, or global societal collapse, his friend the entrepreneur Sam Altman told the New Yorker in 2016. Architectural drawings show an undulating building, embedded in the hillside and partly hidden from view. Consent documents described “a series of stand-alone buildings, including a lodge for visitor accommodation for up to 24 guests, accommodation pod for the owner, together with associated lodge management buildings, infrastructure, landscape treatment, water features and meditation space”. Plans for the meditation pod were scrapped from the final proposal, but the earthworks required to build the lodge would still cover more than 73,700 sq metres (18 acres) of land. The structure was designed by the Japanese architects Kengo Kuma and Associates, who created the Tokyo Olympic stadium. Thiel’s proposal was to build the lodge at Mount Alpha, which is classed as an “outstanding natural landscape” in New Zealand, and subject to special protections. Independent commissioners who reviewed the consent on behalf of council wrote that when they visited the site, “all members were shocked at the frequency at which substantial parts of the proposal would be in plain and direct view”. “The proposal will include a large, very long building that … will substantially detract from the quality and naturalness of the outstanding natural landscape … in the context of the Mt Alpha [landscape] they are not appropriate,” they wrote. Representatives of Second Star argued that the architects “designed the proposal to blend the buildings into the undulating landscape” that surrounded them and that the lodge would “create high-end accommodation in the region, whereby the economic benefits reach across the district and beyond”. The council received a number of submissions from residents and environmental groups opposed to the lodge being built, or requested changes to plans. In one submission, a local resident, John Sutton, said the lodge would “destroy our beautiful lake environment”. In another, the Upper Clutha Environmental Society said the site was “wholly within and surrounded by … landscape of national importance” and the development was “likely to cause significant adverse physical changes”. Thiel gained New Zealand citizenship in 2011, despite spending just 12 days in the country. The usual route to citizenship requires applicants to be in the country as a permanent resident for at least 1,350 days in five years – but the government waived the requirement on the basis of his entrepreneurial and philanthropic activities. The decision was only publicly revealed in 2017 and proved highly controversial in New Zealand. More recently, Thiel has emerged as an increasingly powerful and controversial figure in US politics, using his fortune to pump tens of millions into the campaigns of candidates aligned to Donald Trump’s agenda in the midterm elections. The Guardian has approached representatives of Second Star for comment.","The billionaire Peter Thiel’s plans for an elaborate bunker-like lodge in a remote part of New Zealand’s South Island have been thwarted, after the local council decided the home would have too great a negative impact on the surrounding landscape. “The proposal will include a large, very long building that … will substantially detract from the quality and naturalness of the outstanding natural landscape … in the context of the Mt Alpha [landscape] they are not appropriate,” they wrote.

159,159,"Google is tweaking its search results in an effort to prioritise “content by people, for people” and fight back against the scourge of clickbait, the company says. “We know people don’t find content helpful if it seems like it was designed to attract clicks rather than inform readers,” Danny Sullivan, from Google, said in a blog post. “Many of us have experienced the frustration of visiting a webpage that seems like it has what we’re looking for, but doesn’t live up to our expectations. The content might not have the insights you want, or it may not even seem like it was created for, or even by, a person.” So-called “SEO spam”, content written explicitly for the purposes of appearing high up on the results pages of search engines, has long been a thorn in the side of companies like Google. To tackle it, the company is launching a “helpful content update” next week. The update covers a number of tweaks to the company’s ranking algorithms that attempt to identify content “that seems to have been primarily created for ranking well in search engines rather than to help or inform people”. Google says that, in tests, the update has resulted in particular improvements for searches related to online education, arts and entertainment, shopping and technology. In one example, Sullivan says, a search about a recent movie can sometimes bring up articles that simply aggregate reviews from other sites; now, “you’ll see more results with unique, authentic information, so you’re more likely to read something you haven’t seen before”. There are winners and losers from such changes, of course, and online publishers may fear that their content strategies will see them caught up in the net. In its advice for “content creators”, Google implies that some of the signals it will use to downgrade search results are whether or not a website has a primary purpose or focus, and whether there is “an existing or intended audience” that would find the content useful if they came directly to the page. The “banhammer” will be wielded liberally. “Any content – not just unhelpful content – on sites determined to have relatively high amounts of unhelpful content overall is less likely to perform well in search, assuming there is other content elsewhere from the web that’s better to display,” Google says. “For this reason, removing unhelpful content could help the rankings of your other content.” In recent months, Google has launched a concerted effort to fight perceptions that the company’s search products have grown worse over time. Headlines like “It’s not just you, Google search really is getting worse” and “Google search has gotten worse. Here’s the trick people have found to get around it” blame the company’s increasing desire to offer structured results, paid-for adverts and links to other Google services above simple web links, as well as the constant cat-and-mouse game with SEO spam, and suggest focusing on sites like Reddit to find useful answers to queries. Navneet Alang, writing in the Toronto Star, called the process a “sort of vicious cycle”. “Google endlessly refines search to try and predict what people want, but in response, entire industries work to pollute search results by giving people a cheap, knock-off version of what they want,” he wrote.","The content might not have the insights you want, or it may not even seem like it was created for, or even by, a person.” So-called “SEO spam”, content written explicitly for the purposes of appearing high up on the results pages of search engines, has long been a thorn in the side of companies like Google.

160,160,"Apple users have been advised to immediately update their iPhones, iPads and Macs to protect against a pair of security vulnerabilities that can allow attackers to take complete control of their devices. In both cases, Apple said, there are credible reports that hackers are already abusing the vulnerabilities to attack users. One of the software weaknesses affects the kernel, the deepest layer of the operating system that all the devices have in common, Apple said. The other affects WebKit, the underlying technology of the Safari web browser. For each of the bugs, the company said it was “aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited,” though it provided no further details. It credited an anonymous researcher or researchers for disclosing both. Anyone with an iPhone released since 2015, an iPad released since 2014 or a Mac running macOS Monterey can download the update by opening up the settings menu on their mobile device, or choosing “software update” on the “about this Mac” menu on their computer. Rachel Tobac, the CEO of SocialProof Security, said Apple’s explanation of the vulnerability meant a hacker could get “full admin access to the device” so that they can “execute any code as if they are you, the user”. Those who should be particularly attentive to updating their software are “people who are in the public eye”, such as activists or journalists who might be the targets of sophisticated nation-state spying, Tobac said. Until the fix was released on Wednesday, the vulnerabilities will have been classed as “zero-day” bugs, because there has been a fix available for them for zero days. Such weaknesses are hugely valuable on the open market, where cyberweapon brokers will buy them for hundreds of thousands, or millions, of dollars. The broker Zerodium, for instance, will pay “up to $500,000” for a security weakness that can be used to hack a user through Safari, and up to $2m for a fully developed piece of malware that can hack an iPhone without a user needing to click on anything. The company says its customers for such weaknesses are “government institutions (mainly from Europe and North America)”. Commercial spyware companies such as Israel’s NSO Group are known for identifying and taking advantage of such flaws, exploiting them in malware that surreptitiously infects targets’ smartphones, siphons their contents and surveils the targets in real time. NSO Group has been blacklisted by the US commerce department. Its spyware is known to have been used in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America against journalists, dissidents and human rights activists. Will Strafach, a security researcher, said he had seen no technical analysis of the vulnerabilities that Apple has just patched. The company has previously acknowledged similarly serious flaws and, on what Strafach estimated to be perhaps a dozen occasions, has noted that it was aware of reports that such security holes had been exploited.","One of the software weaknesses affects the kernel, the deepest layer of the operating system that all the devices have in common, Apple said.

161,161,"Priti Patel has hit out at Facebook’s plans to encrypt direct messages, even as the company is facing criticism in the US for failing to protect the privacy of women seeking abortions. The UK home secretary has urged Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, to reconsider its intentions to apply “end-to-end encryption” to direct messages sent from Messenger and Instagram. The technology, already enabled on WhatsApp, prevents anyone other than the sender and recipient of a message from accessing its contents – including Facebook itself, as well as law enforcement and state security agencies. Writing in the Telegraph, Patel warned that the feature could limit the ability of police to investigate and prevent child abuse. “Parents need to know that their kids will be safe online. The consequences of inadequate protections – especially for end-to-end encrypted social media platforms – would be catastrophic,” she wrote. “A great many child predators use social media platforms such as Facebook to discover, target and sexually abuse children. These protections need to be in place before end-to-end encryption is rolled out around the world. Child safety must never be an afterthought.” Patel’s comments were prompted by an announcement earlier this month that Facebook would be moving ahead with plans to test the change. Although the company said the plans for the test had been in place for a long time, it announced the decision shortly after it came under intense criticism for handing over to police the direct messages of a 17-year-old accused of having an illegal abortion in Nebraska. Facebook says it did not know that the police were investigating an abortion when it handed over the data, but US pro-choice groups lambasted the company’s cooperation with investigators. At Netroots Nation, an American gathering of leftwing groups, activists postered the company’s stand with signs saying “Facebook isn’t free” and “Fix Facebook now”, prompting the company to leave the booth unstaffed for the second day of the conference. With end-to-end encryption enabled, the company would have been unable to hand the data to the police, even if they were in possession of a legally binding search warrant. But it would also be unable to monitor communications between users for other reasons, such as to find and report child abuse imagery being shared in direct messages. In 2021, Facebook alone found and reported 22m pieces of child abuse imagery to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, a US nonprofit that coordinates responses to child abuse online. Instagram reported an additional 3.3m, and there are fears among activists that end-to-end encryption could bring those numbers plummeting down, representing many millions of instances of sharing of child abuse imagery disappearing from view. “Meta’s announcement that they are testing default end-to-end encryption before ensuring effective child safety mitigations are in place will pose an immediate risk to children,” Andy Burrows, NSPCC head of child safety online policy, said. “Private messaging is the frontline of child sexual abuse online and this will start to blindfold the company, meaning less child abuse will be detected.” Patel’s comments come as the fate of the online safety bill, which aims to create a new internet regulator with powers over sites such as Facebook, hangs in the balance. The bill, which failed to make it on to the legislative timetable before the summer recess, will probably be revived in some form by the next prime minister, but the tone of the Conservative leadership contest has been sharply dismissive of aspects of the bill that are seen as “legislating for offence”, including efforts to clean up older laws such as the Malicious Communications Act by replacing them with a new offence of “harmful communications”. In a statement, a Meta spokesperson said: “Experts are clear that technologies like those proposed in this paper would undermine end-to-end encryption and threaten people’s privacy, security and human rights. We have no tolerance for child exploitation on our platforms and are focused on solutions that do not require the intrusive scanning of people’s private conversations. We want to prevent harm from happening in the first place, not just detect it after the fact. “We already do this by banning suspicious profiles, restricting adults from messaging children they’re not connected with and defaulting under-18s to private or “friends only” accounts. We’re also encouraging people to report harmful messages to us so we can see the reported contents, respond swiftly and make referrals to the authorities. We continue to work with outside experts and law enforcement to help keep people safe online.” • This article was amended on 24 August 2022 to clarify in the headline and text that Priti Patel has urged Meta to reconsider its end-to-end encryption plans, not to “give up on” them, as an earlier version said.","Although the company said the plans for the test had been in place for a long time, it announced the decision shortly after it came under intense criticism for handing over to police the direct messages of a 17-year-old accused of having an illegal abortion in Nebraska.

162,162,"The Uniting church has told staff in Victoria and Tasmania to avoid using Uber services as the company does not align with its values. In communications sent to staff this month, the church, which is one of the largest non-government providers of community services in Australia, said Uber had built its business on “unethical foundations”. It said this included treating its drivers as independent contractors and adopting a legal structure that was designed to avoid paying income tax on significant parts of its profits. The church’s decision was made in part because of the Guardian’s Uber files investigation, which uncovered how the company broke the law, duped police and regulators and secretly lobbied governments across the world. The Uniting church’s synod of Victoria and Tasmania is the first to break from Uber, but other states are also considering their position. It is understood a number of other Australian church-based and secular organisations are weighing a similar indefinite suspension of Uber services. In its email to staff announcing the change, the church says staff should only use Uber and other ride-share providers for work purposes when taxi services are unavailable. It lists a series of grievances with the company, including that it “set itself up illegally in many places and then lobbied to get laws changed to accept its presence” and that it “played … workers off against each other, undermining pay and conditions for workers in the taxi industry”. The church said it was concerned a high proportion of Uber workers were earning below the minimum legal wage and there were compromises relating to the safety of drivers and passengers. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The moderator of the synod of Victoria and Tasmania, the Rev David Fotheringham, said staff supported the move. “Staff have generally been very supportive, we haven’t had any significant pushback at all,” he said. “The staff are very much on board with us trying to be ethical in all the decisions we make around purchasing, they’re used to paying attention to these things. “The darker side of the story has been coming out over time … certainly the Uber files highlighted just what is going on at an international level and we’re really concerned [about] the local impact.” Fotheringham said the church had previously taken similar stands because of concerns about workers’ rights, including for cleaners and clothing manufacturers. The church did not approach Uber about its stance, and the company disputed many of the reasons it had given for its decision. “While no doubt well-intentioned, this characterisation is unfortunate and not representative of the way the Uber platform operates,” an Uber spokesperson said. “We welcome the opportunity to discuss these concerns directly with the church. The safety of everyone who uses the Uber platform is fundamental … and we are also committed to improving standards for independent contractors in the gig economy, while at the same time protecting the flexibility and independence we know they value.”","The church’s decision was made in part because of the Guardian’s Uber files investigation, which uncovered how the company broke the law, duped police and regulators and secretly lobbied governments across the world.

163,163,"On 15 September, the ethereum blockchain is planning to switch off its mining rigs. If it happens, it should reduce the carbon emissions of the entire ethereum ecosystem by orders of magnitude overnight, leaving bitcoin as the only major cryptocurrency to be built on the destructive proof-of-work concept. But the switchover could also throw some of the largest institutions in the sector into chaos, and seems likely to evolve into a cold war between the new version of ethereum and the diehard followers of the old. And that’s if it happens at all. A brief refresher on cryptocurrencies. The two biggest in the world, ethereum and bitcoin, are based on an idea called proof of work. This – and I’m simplifying – involves the networks outsourcing their security to a decentralised network of miners, who compete to burn ludicrous amounts of electrical energy to generate lottery tickets. Each time a winning lottery ticket is generated, the miner who did so gets a reward (for bitcoin, that is currently 6.25BTC – about £110,000), and gets to verify all the transactions that have happened since the last winner, packaging them up into a neat block, and adding them on to the chain made up of all previous blocks. They stamp the block with their lottery number and the process begins again. Nearly all of the above paragraph is false, so please do not write to me. It is true enough for what follows: this proof-of-work model is at the root of everything you’ve heard about the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies. And ethereum is planning to drop it. The replacement is called proof of stake. Conceptually, it is more complex, but with the same broad brushstrokes we can describe it like this: rather than burning electricity to generate lottery tickets, you instead use your ethereum to buy premium bonds, and the system picks a winner in proportion to the amount of bonds they’ve bought, who then gets to do all the validation stuff as normal. You can cash out of your premium bonds, but the process is slow, so you are motivated not to abuse your validation privileges. A version of ethereum has been running on those principles for a while. It’s had different names over the years, from testnet to Eth2, but on 15 September it’s going to become simply ethereum. This switchover, dubbed “the merge” – because the old and the new networks will be merged together – has a good shot at being the single largest technological event ever to happen in the crypto space. Which means it has a good shot at being messy as hell. To start, there’s the date. If you’ve noticed a soupçon of scepticism, it’s because I’ve been burned before. I wrote about the forthcoming merge being “months away” – in May 2021: The switch to proof of stake has been planned for several years, with a host of problems, both technical and organisational, delaying implementation. But now, according to Carl Beekhuizen, a research and development staffer at the Ethereum Foundation … the change will be complete “in the upcoming months”. It was not. But this time, the switch is rather more final. For one thing, there’s an actual hard date; for another, the preparation for the merge is now live in the code that runs the ethereum network. It could still be delayed, but the default case, if no further action is taken, is that the merge will happen as planned. What’s at stake That doesn’t mean the merge will be smooth. The first stumbling block will be the forks: clones of the old version of ethereum, spun up to keep the proof of work system alive. This won’t be the first time this has happened. There’s untold bitcoin forks, with names like bitcoin cash, bitcoin satoshi vision, bitcoin classic and bitcoin gold, but none have ever toppled the original’s dominance. So why might the ethereum fork have more of a chance? Because it will almost certainly have the backing of a powerful constituency: ethereum miners. After years at the centre of ethereum infrastructure, the miners face their industry being simply switched off overnight, and many of them aren’t happy with that proposal. They have real, physical assets invested in the continuation of a proof-of-work cryptocurrency, from expensive graphics cards to electrical hookups, and it’s not easy to repurpose it for something else. Due to the open-source nature of cryptocurrencies, it’s easy enough for the miners to simply pick up where they left off, and carry on running Nu-thereum, or whatever it gets called, on 16 September as though the merge had never happened. The question is, what happens next? Everyone who has a balance of ETH will suddenly find that they have two balances, one on each blockchain. And everyone who has a smart contract running on ETH will suddenly find they have two of them, as well: there will be the proof-of-work version of the Bored Ape NFTs, and the proof-of-stake version, and so on. Some of those duplicates may happily coexist. Others might try to talk down the forked version, but never quite kill it – how much would someone who wants to own a killer NFT pay for an “unofficial” version on the forked chain? If it’s not zero, then the trade could continue for some time, even if the developers of the Apes disown the forks. But for other projects, there can only be one. Each USDC token is backed by $1 of hard assets held by Circle, the company that develops the stablecoin. If there are suddenly twice as many USDCs because of the fork, Circle doesn’t have twice as much cash, and it will have to choose one network to support and the other to reject. It seems unlikely that the big stablecoins, like USDC and Tether, will back the rebel chain. And that, in turn, means the entire rebel ecosystem will come into existence in a slow-motion collapse, as forked projects fail one by one. But it will still provide a base for new creation, and one that is ultimately more similar to the ethereum developers know and love than the environmentally friendly version it is about to morph into. What’s next The upstart miners aren’t solely acting out of self-interest. There is a point of principle at stake, as well, which is the decentralisation that underpins the crypto economy. That decentralisation is, at heart, the only real reason for cryptocurrencies to exist: a centralised conventional database is faster, cheaper and safer to run, but requires you to trust whoever is running it. A decentralised cryptocurrency can’t be interfered with by big business, or big government, which makes them great for – well, crime and evasion of government regulations, in the main, but also loftier concepts like “permissionless innovation” and “uncensorable speech”. Some of the backers of the proof-of-work (PoW) concept – including the bitcoin “maximalists” who look down even on upstarts like ethereum – worry that proof of stake (PoS) ultimately results in Dino: decentralisation in name only. The nature of the system involves handing control of the network to those with the most money held within the network. Worse, it hands extra power to those who look after other people’s money: centralised exchanges like Coinbase or Binance, and centralised notbanks like Celsius or Voyager, if they’d survived that long. Those exchanges can offer “staking” services where they do the hard technical bit of making proof of stake work (buying the premium bonds, in the terms of my fantastic analogy), and their customers get the rewards. The rise of the Dinos is more than just a theoretical concern. In a post-Tornado Cash world – still dealing with the fallout of North Korea’s favourite decentralised app being accused of money laundering and sanctioned by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) – it isn’t at all clear whether it is legal under US law for a “validator”, the PoS replacement for miners, to approve a block that contains a transaction to or from a sanctioned address. Ethereum’s developers are trying to force the matter, proposing a “credible commitment to punish censors”. What that means is not yet clear, but the hope is that it doesn’t have to be – that the credible commitment means that organisations who have to comply with OFAC simply do not stake ethereum in the first place. It is not entirely clear what an ethereum with no validators who are trying to remain in compliance with US sanctions would look like. But that is the world we’re heading to.

164,164,"New whistleblower allegations of widespread security threats and spam concerns at Twitter may give Elon Musk ammunition in his fight to back out of a deal to buy the company. On Tuesday, an 84-page complaint written by Twitter’s former security chief turned whistleblower, Peiter Zatko, alleged that Twitter prioritizes user growth over reducing spam, did not have a plan in place for major security issues, and that half the company’s servers were running out-of-date and vulnerable software. The accusations come as the social media company battles Musk in court after he attempted to pull out of a $44bn deal to buy the company. In his decision to back out, Musk cited Twitter’s failure to provide details about the prevalence of bot and spam accounts, making the timing of Tuesday’s revelations “amazing” for his case, said Anat Alon-Beck, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio. “It’s almost like a script from the movies – this is very convenient for Musk,” she said. Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan, said on Tuesday that a subpoena had been issued to Zatko for additional information. Alon-Beck said it was not clear how Musk’s legal team will use the new developments in the case. In order to walk away from the deal with Twitter without paying a $1bn termination fee, Musk has to prove a “material adverse effect”: a clause that requires proving an event significantly reduces the long-term value of an acquisition. Until now, Musk has relied on accusations that Twitter fraudulently misrepresented the true number of spam and bot accounts on its social media platform, which the company has estimated in corporate filings make up just 5% of accounts. Musk said he relied on those filings when he offered to buy the company. Twitter has alleged that the billionaire was overstating the scope of the issue as an excuse to back out of the deal, saying in a filing that his claims were based on “distortion, misrepresentation, and outright deception”. But the new whistleblower allegations add another dimension to his argument, said Ann Lipton, a professor at Tulane Law School, as they include additional claims that Twitter failed to disclose weaknesses in its security and data privacy and provide “a different basis for fraud”. Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s chief executive, told employees in a memo that the company is reviewing the claims. “What we have seen so far is a false narrative that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies, and presented without important context,” Agrawal said, according to a CNN report. In a statement to the Guardian, Rebecca Hahn, Twitter’s global vice-president of communications, said that Zatko’s account lacked “important context”. “Mr. Zatko’s allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders. Security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be,” Hahn added. How, exactly, the report will impact the case will need to play out in court, said Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School. He said the revelations introduce uncertainty to the case rather than dramatically transforming it. “Volatility is helpful if you’re not playing a strong hand. It creates some possibility that something crazy might happen,” he said. “This doesn’t open a brand new battlefront, it’s adding texture to existing ones.” The legal battle has continued ahead of a trial beginning in Delaware on 17 October, with both sides continuing to gather evidence. On Monday, Musk subpoenaed former executive Jack Dorsey for additional information. Twitter has subpoenaed a number of high-profile witnesses as well, including the prominent venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and Paypal founding chief operating officer David Sacks.

165,165,"Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, will complete a plan to lower its carbon emissions by more than 99% in the next month, the foundation that controls the platform has confirmed. The project, called “the merge”, will result in ethereum switching the underlying technology it uses for validating crypto transactions to a new process that requires less energy to manage. Once complete, the merge will end the role of “miners” in the ethereum ecosystem, helping to dramatically reduce electricity usage. These users run huge quantities of powerful, purpose-built technology all day, every day, to generate random numbers that affect the security of the overall network. The energy consumption of ethereum mining is currently estimated at about 72 terawatt-hours a year, according to Alex de Vries, a Dutch economist who runs the Digiconomist website. That is comparable with the power consumption of Colombia, with a carbon footprint equivalent to that of Switzerland. The changeover will lead to the platform moving away from a “proof of work” process, which requires cryptocurrency miners to generate random numbers to verify records stored on the blockchain – the technology underpinning digital currencies such as ethereum and the more popular bitcoin. Ethereum will instead use a “proof of stake” process, in which the network will be secured by users who “stake” sums of the cryptocurrency, committing themselves to acting honestly at the risk of losing it. De Vries said the switchover would eliminate the majority of electricity usage. “They could cut off a huge chunk of their power demand. I will be working on quantifying that more accurately but at least 99% (probably even 99.9%) reduction should be achievable. This translates to something like the electricity consumption of a country like Portugal (a quarter of all data centres in the world combined) vanishing overnight.” The proof-of-stake model is currently being used on an experimental “beacon” blockchain, where it has been tested to ensure that the theoretical security it provides is sufficient for the multibillion-dollar economy that sits on top of the ethereum network. Now the experimental blockchain will take over the work of the main network. “Imagine ethereum is a spaceship that isn’t quite ready for an interstellar voyage,” the ethereum foundation said, explaining the merge. “With the beacon chain, the community has built a new engine and a hardened hull. After significant testing, it’s almost time to hot-swap the new engine for the old midflight. This will merge the new, more efficient engine into the existing ship, ready to put in some serious lightyears and take on the universe.” There are still potential problems ahead. The foundation said users needed to watch out for an increase in scam activity because hackers could take advantage of the confusion around the switchover to try to trick users into giving up their passwords, their funds or both. “You should be on high alert for scams trying to take advantage of users during this transition,” the organisation said. “Do not send your ETH anywhere in an attempt to ‘upgrade to ETH2’. There is no ETH2 token, and there is nothing more you need to do for your funds to remain safe.” The final stages of the merge are expected to begin on 6 September, the foundation said, with the old blockchain switched off at some point between 10 and 20 September. Ethereum will not be the first network to use proof of stake, and others including cardano and solana have demonstrated the technology at a smaller scale. But its switchover will leave bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, facing renewed criticism for its continued reliance on proof of work. The bitcoin network uses 130TWh of electricity a year, De Vries estimates, a sum that will be increasingly difficult to defend if the ethereum blockchain demonstrates that the same capabilities can be achieved in an environmentally friendly manner.","The changeover will lead to the platform moving away from a “proof of work” process, which requires cryptocurrency miners to generate random numbers to verify records stored on the blockchain – the technology underpinning digital currencies such as ethereum and the more popular bitcoin.

166,166,"Internet shutdowns come in different forms, ranging from the hammer of a complete blackout to screwdriver-style arrangements targeting certain populations. These are some methods used by governments around the world to switch off the internet. The Hammer The nuclear option. On 5 August 2019, India’s Hindu Nationalist government revoked the special status of the Kashmir region, unilaterally wiping out its autonomy. It also sent in thousands of army troops and severed internet, mobile and telephone connections. The region would remain offline for 552 days, the world’s longest shutdown to date. This type of extreme option is used across many countries every year on a short-term basis for reasons as trivial as trying to stop cheating in examinations. In Syria, the entire network including mobile internet is blacked out when students do their high-school matriculation exams, while parts of India take down the mobile network for trainee teacher exams. Screwdriver approaches Speed throttling: Speed throttling slows down the internet so that 4G suddenly becomes a glacial 2G. This can stop or delay news of atrocities or human rights violations from emerging as internet speeds are too slow for streaming or uploading video. Speed throttling can be combined with approaches that deprive certain groups of internet access; for example, geographically based blocks targeting particularly restive provinces or blocks on private internet connections. The latter happened in Iran in February 2012 on the third anniversary of the Twitter Revolution, when the platform was used to organise street protests in opposition to President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad’s controversial election victory. Private internet connections were blocked, while state-run internet users continued to enjoy normal speeds. This meant that protest organisers could no longer share information or mobilise, while allowing financial and state-run institutions to continue operating. Blacklisting or blocklisting: Blocking access to a particular platform is a common tactic to stem the flow of information and is called blacklisting – or more recently blocklisting, as the cyber community moves towards using more inclusive language. In Myanmar on 4 February, three days after the coup, the military blocked Facebook, effectively shutting most Burmese from their primary gateway to the internet. The ministry of communications and information justified the block in the name of national stability, writing “fake news and misinformation and … misunderstanding among people by using Facebook”. The Facebook ban was devastating to small business owners who were heavily reliant on the platform. “My mom cooked food and sold it on her Facebook page and account, so she couldn’t do her online business,” said one woman in Yangon, describing how the ban destroyed her mother’s business in one fell swoop. Whitelisting or allowlisting: This transforms the internet into an intranet. Rather than blacklisting things on the open internet, websites are approved on a closed intranet, effectively creating a walled garden for government-sanctioned platforms. “It’s inverting the normal of the internet, where everything is accessible and only certain things might be restricted or blocked,” says Access Now’s Raman Singh. In Myanmar, this allowed military-run interests to operate and crippled business to restart, while continuing to stymie the communication functions offered by the internet. After this, the military junta began to trial whitelisting. Burmese were given access to just 1,200 military-sanctioned internet sites, which included banking and finance sites, gaming and entertainment sites like Netflix and YouTube, and some news sites like the New York Times. Social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter remained inaccessible. Connectivity returned, but the number of sites accessible was drastically lower. “Effectively what they’ve done is recreated the censorship board, but for the online space,” says Free Expression Myanmar’s Oliver Spencer, referring to the censorship body that had operated for 50 years until 2012. A firewall: China’s firewall is an example of extreme whitelisting. Although it has used the kill switch in the past, Beijing appears to have moved away from this method, instead depending on sophisticated internet controls. In 2009, Beijing switched off internet access to the Xinjiang region for 10 months after riots fuelled by ethnic tensions. This was seen as a move to stop political organising and limit news of the ensuing crackdown, which punished the entire population. However, even as the Communist party has set up massive political indoctrination centres, impounding at least a million Uyghurs, it has not shut off the internet in the region again. One factor is the efficacy of Beijing’s controls over the internet, which means that the blunt tool of total shutdown is no longer necessary; the monitoring and censorship provided by China’s great firewall effectively prevents most Chinese internet users from accessing the global web, while limiting the content they post. “They don’t need to make this kind of grubby, ham-fisted shutting down of a major tool of economic activity,” says Simon Angus from the IP Observatory. “The internet is their friend for both messaging and communication.” In one version of the future, following China’s lead, internet shutdowns may no longer be necessary as governments perfect their control over their own respective internets. This trend points towards a “splinternet” instead of a global internet, where the internet is broken up into a series of intranets governed on a sovereign – sometimes hyperlocal or regional – basis. But government control of the web faces one new hurdle: satellite internet. Satellite internet Elon Musk’s Starlink technology uses constellations of satellites in low-earth orbit to beam high-speed internet access into Ukraine, which allows the government to continue communications and bypass Russian servers, even as Russia destroys and diverts terrestrial internet infrastructure. The country’s military communications, combat warfare and all its critical infrastructure run from 15,000 Starlink satellite kits, which also allow President Vlodymyr Zelensky to broadcast his daily videos, bolstering domestic morale and garnering international support. Theoretically, satellite internet service such as SpaceX’s Starlink could render internet shutdowns a thing of the past, although in practice this is not yet replicable at scale for the entire population of Ukraine. However, the promise that satellite internet services can allow users to transcend internet blocks is demonstrated in Ukraine every day. It’s being watched closely by Chinese researchers, who are developing new anti-satellite weapons. This story was funded by the Judith Neilson Institute","The latter happened in Iran in February 2012 on the third anniversary of the Twitter Revolution, when the platform was used to organise street protests in opposition to President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad’s controversial election victory.

167,167,"California lawmakers passed first-of-its-kind legislation on Monday designed to improve the online safety and privacy protections for children. The bill, the California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act, will require firms such as TikTok, Instagram and YouTube to install guardrails for users under the age of 18, including defaulting to higher privacy settings for minors and refraining from collecting location data for those users. It also requires companies to analyze their algorithms and products to determine how they may affect young users, assessing whether they are designed to be addictive or could cause additional harm to children. Children’s safety advocates have applauded the bill, which passed in a vote of 33 to 0, saying similar federal legislation is needed to protect young users. The bill is “a huge step forward toward creating the internet that children and families deserve”, said Josh Golin, executive director at advocacy group Fairplay. “For far too long, tech companies have treated their egregious privacy and safety issues as a PR problem to be addressed only through vague promises, obfuscations, and delays,” he said. “Now, tech platforms will be required to prioritize young Californians’ interests and wellbeing ahead of reckless growth and shareholder dividends.” Meanwhile some privacy advocates have raised concerns about the sweeping scope of the bill, as it may require all users to authenticate their age and restrict anonymous browsing online. “The bill will dramatically degrade the internet experience for everyone and will empower a new censorship-focused regulator who has no interest or expertise in balancing complex and competing interests,” wrote Eric Goldman, a law professor and critic of the bill. California is the first state in the US to pass legislation auditing apps “likely to be accessed” by users under the age of 18. It comes after the state failed to pass a separate bill targeting online children’s safety earlier in August. That bill, AB 2408, would have allowed companies to be sued for designing features that keep young users addicted to the app. The bill now faces a final vote before being sent to the governor, Gavin Newsom, to be signed into law. If enacted, it will go into effect in 2024 and companies could face fines as high as $7,500 per user if found to be violating the protective measures for children. The bill reflects similar legislation, called the Age Appropriate Design Code, that went into effect in the UK in 2021. It comes as social media firms face more scrutiny for their public health impact, particularly on their most young and vulnerable users. In 2021, Meta whistleblower Frances Haugen revealed internal research at the Instagram parent company that showed the drastic mental health impacts of the app on teen users. Such revelations intensified calls from advocacy groups to strengthen protections for young users. Many have called for the federal children protection law, known as Coppa, to be updated to better protect children. The passage of the California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act is “a monumental step toward protecting California kids online”, said Jim Steyer, founder and CEO of children’s online safety organization Common Sense Media, but more action needs to be taken. The act “is only part of the change we need to better protect young people from the manipulative and dangerous practices online platforms employ today”, he said. “California legislators, and lawmakers around the country, need to follow up on this important development by enacting additional online privacy and platform accountability measures.”","The bill, the California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act, will require firms such as TikTok, Instagram and YouTube to install guardrails for users under the age of 18, including defaulting to higher privacy settings for minors and refraining from collecting location data for those users. “Now, tech platforms will be required to prioritize young Californians’ interests and wellbeing ahead of reckless growth and shareholder dividends.” Meanwhile some privacy advocates have raised concerns about the sweeping scope of the bill, as it may require all users to authenticate their age and restrict anonymous browsing online. “The bill will dramatically degrade the internet experience for everyone and will empower a new censorship-focused regulator who has no interest or expertise in balancing complex and competing interests,” wrote Eric Goldman, a law professor and critic of the bill.

168,168,"The company behind Snapchat is making about 1,300 staff redundant and cutting investment in projects such as augmented reality glasses, as the social media business fights an advertising downturn. Snap’s chief executive said the latest quarterly revenue growth of 8% was “well below” expectations and the company’s planning includes assumptions that a weak advertising market continues into next year. “Unfortunately, given our current lower rate of revenue growth, it has become clear that we must reduce our cost structure to avoid incurring significant ongoing losses,” said CEO and cofounder Evan Spiegel. Spiegel told staff the US-based company would cut its 6,400-strong workforce by 20% and stop investment in areas such as mobile games and its drone camera, Pixy. Snap is also closing its Originals division, which has produced content from stars such as Megan Thee Stallion and Anthony Joshua. The job cuts come after a profit warning in May was followed by disappointing results in July as Snap, which makes more than two-thirds of its revenue in North America, said advertisers were being hit by supply chain disruptions, labour shortages and high inflation. Privacy changes implemented by Apple have also made it difficult for social media companies to target users with digital advertising or measure its impact. In a presentation slide for investors accompanying the announcement, Snap said it would be “narrowing” its investment in AR glasses, which overlay digital images on what a wearer sees. The spectacles, which exist in a prototype form, have been much-heralded by Snap, but the company said it would now focus on long-term research and development for the glasses. Snap shares rose 9.2% to $10.93 (£9.39) on the news, as investors took reassurance from the company’s decision to pare back investment in some areas of its business. Snap’s messaging app has 347 million users worldwide. “By going ‘back-to-basics’ and streamlining its focus on to its core product, Snap has a good chance of coming out of this, though it will take time,” said Jasmine Enberg, an analyst at Insider Intelligence, a market research company. As part of the changes, Snap’s senior vice-president of engineering, Jerry Hunter, will be promoted to a new role of chief operating officer and will be responsible for improving coordination between engineering, ad sales and product teams, Spiegel said. The company said it would focus on improving sales and the number of Snapchat users. The “clear and defining action” to refocus its business has reassured investors, said Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight. Analysts and investors have viewed Snap as an early indicator for trends affecting other social media platforms, as Snap is usually first to report quarterly earnings or provide business updates. If the 8% growth rate flagged in Snap’ statement holds, it would be the slowest Snap has recorded since becoming a public company in 2017 – a far cry from triple-digit growth rates recorded in previous quarters. Two of Snap’s top ad sales executives – chief business officer, Jeremi Gorman, and vice-president of ad sales, Peter Naylor – are leaving to join Netflix and build the streaming service’s ad business.","The spectacles, which exist in a prototype form, have been much-heralded by Snap, but the company said it would now focus on long-term research and development for the glasses. “By going ‘back-to-basics’ and streamlining its focus on to its core product, Snap has a good chance of coming out of this, though it will take time,” said Jasmine Enberg, an analyst at Insider Intelligence, a market research company.
